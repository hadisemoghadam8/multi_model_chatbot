Across 52 studies of preferences, the average effect size was d = .63, indicating a moderately strong preference for a therapist of one’s own race/ethnicity. Across 81 studies of individuals’ perceptions of therapists, the average effect size was d = .32, indicating a tendency to perceive therapists of one’s own race/ethnicity somewhat more positively than other therapists. Across 53 studies of client outcomes in mental health treatment, the average effect size was d = .09, indicating almost no benefit to treatment outcomes from racial/ethnic matching of clients with therapists.

The concerns expressed in these reports have paralleled a dramatic increase in the number of studies investigating multicultural issues in mental health interventions and associated indications of the importance of increasing multicultural competence among mental health professionals (Ponterotto, Casas, Suzuki, & Alexander, 2009). To improve mental health services for people of color, professionals have emphasized the need for cultural congruence between therapists and clients (Pope-Davis, Coleman, Liu, & Toporek, 2003; Smith, 2009). Matching therapists with clients of the same ethnicity is one aspect of practice that has received sustained attention across several decades (e.g., Møllersen, Sexton, & Holte, 2009; Sue, Fujino, Hu, Takeuchi, & Zane, 1991).

This presumption has sound theoretical underpinnings in social psychology. Worldview similarity fosters interpersonal attraction (Byrne, 1971). People tend to be attracted to those who share similar perceived physical attributes (e.g., Berscheid, Dion, Walster, & Walster, 1971). People typically associate with those they perceive to be similar to themselves (Newcomb, 1961). The application of these well-established tenets to therapy is obvious: clients should tend to prefer therapists who are similar to themselves. Interpersonal similarity not"

According to theories of consensus bias (i.e., Ross, Greene, & House, 1977; Marks & Miller, 1987), people tend to perceive their own judgments as being shared by others and alternative perspectives as being unusual or even unacceptable, such that perceptions of similarity with others are normative when contradictory information is unavailable. People typically presume similarity with others (Robbins & Kreuger, 2005) unless differences are brought to attention, such as by physical appearance differences across race/ethnicity.

If the therapeutic alliance is likely strengthened under conditions of interpersonal similarity, then it stands to reason that client outcomes in therapy should also benefit. Indeed there is some research evidence that similarities in the values of client and therapist predict positive client outcome (Kelly & Strupp, 1992). Racial/ethnic matching may therefore improve client outcomes by enhancing mutual understanding between client and therapist and by reducing client concerns about being misunderstood or Running head: ETHNIC MATCHING 6 mistreated (e.g., Kohatsu et al., 2000). At a more pragmatic level, it seems reasonable that shared social networks and shared community structures may also enhance therapist awareness of accessible resources and sources of support.

Even when therapist and client share ethnic backgrounds, interpersonal differences remain on other variables (socioeconomic status, religion, etc.). Thus a presumption of similarity (based on race alone) may result in disappointment, particularly when client and therapist have incongruous values. This difference between expected vs. actual similarity could weaken the degree to which meeting clients’ preferences for racial/ethnic matching translates into improved therapeutic outcomes. Studies of client preferences tap into projected imagination; potential clients asked by a researcher about their racial/ethnic preferences likely imagine a therapist who also shares their own gender, political opinions, etc. Thus studies of individuals’ preferences may blur the issue of racial/ethnic similarity with overall interpersonal similarity.

Subsequently, Shin and colleagues (2005) summarized ten studies between 1991 and 2001. Data specific to African American clients indicated minimal effects of racial/ethnic matching on drop out, number of sessions attended, and post- treatment functioning (d’s = -.19, -.01, and -.28, respectively). Thus previous reviews have generally concluded that although people of color prefer therapists of their own race/ethnicity, racial/ethnic matching in therapy does not improve client outcomes.

For instance, White/European American clients may implicitly expect to see a therapist of their own race and may therefore initially mistrust a therapist of color, but this possibility has not yet been confirmed. In contrast, research has consistently shown that African American clients tend to mistrust mental health services provided by White/European American therapists (O’Sullivan, Peterson, Cox, & Kirkeby, 1989; Snowden, 1999; Sue, 1977; Sussman, Robins, & Earls, 1987). Explanations for this finding include the possibility of a perceived racial bias in the provision of mental health services and the implicit association of mental health services with the values of White/European Americans (Maultsby, 1982; Ridley, 1984). Moreover, racial mistrust among African Americans is moderately associated with their psychosocial functioning (Whaley, 2001).

However, some subsequent studies have found that racial/ethnic matching was not as crucial for African American clients as previously believed (e.g., Atkinson & Lowe, 1995). Although conclusions vary somewhat, studies tend to support racial/ethnic matching as being particularly useful for African American clients. The limited literature investigating the effects of racial/ethnic matching with other racial/ethnic minority groups has yielded mixed results (Karlsson, 2005). For example, Running head: ETHNIC MATCHING 10 some evidence indicates that Asian Americans may sometimes prefer White/European American therapists due to internalized racism by Asian Americans (Alvarez & Helms, 2001). Results of studies of the preference for racial/ethnic matching among Asian Americans have been inconsistent (Atkinson, Maruyama, & Matsui, 1978; Atkinson & Matsushita, 1991; Atkinson, Poston, Furlong, & Mercado, 1989).

Attending to common factors (Messer & Wampold, 2002) and components of therapy that are amenable to intervention, like therapist communication skills, would seem to be constructive areas for exploration (see Sue, 1998). Optimally this work would be conducted in clinical settings, given the differences identified in this review between clinical and analogue research. Implications for Practice Even though we live in a multicultural society, with greater diversity than ever before, the practice of matching clients with therapists of the same race/ethnicity is not often feasible. Moreover, if agencies were to adopt rigid policies about matching clients with therapists of the same racial/ethnic background, unintended negative consequences might result (Alladin, 2002). Therapists and/or clients might feel segregated; therapists working primarily with a single population could fail to develop cross-cultural skills; treatment might minimize other meaningful differences such as gender orientation; and treatment might fail to acknowledge that within-group"

Concisely stated, ―Psychotherapy for ethnic minorities is not simply an issue for ethnic minority persons‖ (Nagayama Hall, 2001, p. 508). The results of this meta-analysis suggest that therapists who work with clients of another race/ethnicity can be optimistic rather than fearful; client outcomes are generally Running head: ETHNIC MATCHING 35 unaffected by therapist race/ethnicity. Nevertheless, the results do suggest that therapists need to apply multicultural competencies (Sue, Arredondo, & McDavis, 1992) to foster positive client preferences and perceptions, particularly when working with African American clients. The experiences and perceptions of African American clients significantly differ when they have a therapist of their same race vs. another race. This difference must be addressed.

The data from this meta-analysis also suggest that therapists should not naively believe that all clients are alike (i.e., Neville, Spanierman, & Doan, 2006). The research findings showed substantial variability. This does not suggest that race/ethnicity does not matter for a client, but rather that racial/ethnic dynamics are so complex that prediction is problematic. Individuals’ experiences with race/ethnicity must be acknowledged more than aggregate trends. Therapists who acquire multicultural awareness, knowledge, and skills can work with both similarities and differences to enhance the therapeutic alliance. The focus of cross-cultural mental health interventions needs to remain on issues of effectiveness (Sue, 1998), attending to factors that directly influence clients’ utilization, retention, and outcome in mental health services. Rather than continue to debate the utility of racial/ethnic matching, researchers and practitioners should"

Sue et al., 1992), and professional skills development (Cates, Schaefle, Smaby, Maddux, & LeBeauf, 2007; Smith et al., 2006). Conclusion For decades, psychologists have rightly been concerned about reducing negative stereotyping and increasing positive outcomes of clients whose race/ethnicity differs from that of the therapist (e.g., Ridley, 1984). Matching clients with therapists of their own race/ethnicity has been one strategy for doing so that has been increasingly been overtaken by more practical alternatives, such as the provision of effective multicultural training (Smith et al., 2006). The data summarized in the present meta-analysis indicate that although people prefer to have a therapist of their own race/ethnicity and tend to perceive therapists of their own race/ethnicity somewhat more"

Nevertheless, these averaged findings mask a high degree of variability in the research data; racial/ethnic matching yields inconsistent results. In particular, African Americans and individuals with strong racial/ethnic preferences or mistrust may benefit from being matched with a therapist of their own race/ethnicity. So long as group biases persist in society (e.g., Morrison & Morrison, 2008), racial/ethnic matching will remain relevant to mental health services with discriminated and misunderstood populations. Overall, we believe that it is past time to adopt refined conceptualizations of racial/ethnic dynamics in therapy (e.g., Sue & Zane, 1987) that include proximal variables such as perceived similarity vs. actual similarity. Social psychology has moved past basic tenets about similarity in interpersonal settings (e.g., Berscheid et al., 1971; Byrne, 1971; Newcomb, 1961; Ross et al., 1977; Simon et al., 1970) with theoretical Running head: ETHNIC"
