The current standard VR systems use VR headsets with head-mounted display. VR provides not only visual and auditory stimuli but also tactile and olfactory stimuli. The subjective feeling that a user experiences in VR as “being there” is termed presence. By presenting VR worlds in therapy, the patients’ typical experiences in real life are evoked to improve their behavior and overcome their problems.Patients can enter anxious situations or diffi- cult social situations in VR in which situations can be graded in difficulty and repeatedly rehearsed in the presence of a therapist before the patients try out these new therapeutic strategies in real life.

This review discusses the available evidence on clinical applications of VR therapies for a number of psychiatric disorders, i.e., anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), substance use disorders (SUDs), eating disorders, psychotic disorders, and the neurodevelopmental disorders autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). VR is used for not only treatment but also assessment purposes. VR enables researchers to design scenarios that can be used to assess real-time behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and phys- iological responses to a virtual environment.

Assessment in Social Anxiety Disorder Research has investigated whether VR can be used to reliably and validly assess social anxiety and public speaking anxiety, but results are inconclusive. Until recently, the technology was limited so that the preprogrammed avatars used in conversation could not be controlled to interact and converse with the patient in real time. Powers et al. (2013) investigated a new technology allow- ing the operator to directly control the avatar’s behavior and speaking during VR conversations. Results showed that VR conversation successfully enhanced fear (d = 2.29). Actually, participants rated their fear higher during VR conversation than during in vivo conversation. Kampmann et al.

The in vivo BAT did not prove to be a significant predictor of everyday social anxiety. Other studies have investigated physiological differences between subjects undergoing a VR BAT and those undergoing an in vivo BAT. Generally, a VR BAT (e.g., giving a speech to a virtual audience) and an in vivo BAT resulted in comparable changes in salivary cortisol levels, cardiovascular ac- tivity, electrodermal activity, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and eye movements (fixation duration of faces) (see Emmelkamp et al. 2020)."

Assessment in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Given that some soldiers may overreport PTSD symptoms to get benefits or may underreport PTSD symptoms because of shame, it has been suggested that VR can be used for assessment of PTSD in active duty soldiers and veterans. A few studies have investigated whether psychophys- iological responses when soldiers and veterans are confronted with realistic VR worlds would be more informative than self-reported symptoms, but results so far are inconclusive (see Myers et al. 2016, Rizzo & Shilling 2017). To investigate mechanisms underlying the development of trauma symptoms, VR worlds have been investigated as an analog to real trauma. Up to now, the trauma film paradigm has been used as an analog for posttraumatic stress. Such analog trauma VR worlds proved to be as ef- fective in inducing intrusive memories in a normal population as traumatic film (Cuperus et al. 2017, Dibbets & Schulte-Osterman"

Assessment in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder A number of studies are relevant with respect to the use of VR for assessment purposes. To ex- amine OCD using objective behavioral indices, Kim et al.

In another study, the same group (Kim et al. 2012) used the virtual environment as a diagnostic tool to discriminate patients with checking behavior from those without. These researchers developed a virtual environment with a house and office for the assessment of anxiety and compulsions in patients with OCD. A high level of anxiety was found in patients with OCD with checking behavior relative to OCD patients without checking behavior and healthy controls. Patients with checking behavior showed a higher checking frequency and spent more time on checking and more time on gazing during checking behavior. This finding is in line with more experimental research (van den Hout et al. 2019), in which individuals with obsessive checking be- havior experience greater uncertainty in uncertain situations, which in turn leads them to engage in checking behavior: Feelings of uncertainty provoke checking behavior, and checking behavior preserves feelings of uncertainty."

However, in contrast to the studies by Kim and colleagues (2010, 2012), here it concerned a vir- tual game environment: No 3D goggles to immerse the patient in a 3D perspective were used. Participants navigated through the OCD house looking at a computer screen. Laforest et al. (2016b) investigated whether a VR world could be used to trigger anxiety in OCD patients with contamination.

Participants were asked to “touch” the walls and the toilet seat each time with their hands.

Moreover, in alcohol-abusing patients and in cocaine- and cannabis-using patients, VR has proven to be effective in inducing craving (see Segawa et al. 2020). Regarding alcohol abuse, social pressure by virtual avatars led to greater craving than did virtual alcohol cues (Ghi¸t˘a & Gutiérrez Maldonado 2018).

The dominant theory in explaining the effects of exposure therapy was previously the emotional processing theory (Foa & Kozak 1986), but in recent years the inhibitory learning the- ory has become the preferred theory to explain the powerful effects of exposure (Craske et al. 2014).

Eating Disorders VR is used primarily in a therapeutic context to investigate two main aspects of eating disorders: body image distortions (relevant for anorexia and bulimia nervosa) and uncontrolled eating (binge eating and bulimia). To assess body image distortions, 3D figures of the patient’s body are created and presented to the patient, thus enabling the patient to become aware of the body image dis- tortion and to get a more realistic view of the body. To address uncontrolled eating, cue exposure to eating-related stimuli is used. VR environments simulate real-life situations and food cues that trigger disordered eating behavior. Clus et al.

VR cue exposure may offer several advantages to in vivo exposure, including improved acceptance of treatment, more realistic VR eating environ- ments than the therapist’s office, and the gradual presentation of VR environments tailored to the anxiety hierarchy of the patient.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS Initially designed for the treatment of specific phobias, VR worlds have also been designed for the treatment of other anxiety disorders, PTSD, substance-related disorders, eating disorders, psy- chosis, ADHD, and ASD. The central mechanism in the interventions for these various disorders is, for most of these disorders, exposure to relevant situations that trigger the specific problems related to these disorders.

A few studies, however, found that VR therapy does not necessarily negatively affect the therapeutic relationship. In a study of Ngai et al.

VR devices are becoming increasingly available, and the rapid de- velopment of VR technologies significantly reduces the cost of VR hardware, thus enabling the use of VR applications in the public mental health care sector.

Head- to-head comparisons of virtual reality exposure therapy with evidence-based cognitive behavioral interventions rarely reveal one approach to be superior to any other. 2. There is hardly any research published into the effects of virtual reality therapy in gen- eralized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 3.
