This is motivated by a number of factors: • Mental illnesses have a devastating effect on many people [6] . • Young adults in particular are susceptible to mental illness and are thereby at risk of severe disruption during a critical period of social and intellectual development [7]. • Young adults are enthusiastic users of Internet technologies and social networking [8, 9] and might more easily be reached via an online treatment. • Mental illness carries a significant stigma, so that young people do not want to be identified as mental health clients [10]. • There is a need to supplement existing ‘face-to-face’ therapies, which are time-consuming, expensive and require leave from school or work to travel to a clinic [11]"

Currently, patients with schizophrenia, the most common form of psychosis, occupy approximately 25% of all psychiatric hospital beds in Australia and represent 50% of admissions [6]. • Studies have shown that after recovering from a first psychotic episode, most patients relapse within 2-5 years, suggesting that current interventions should be extended to target this critical period [12]. It is currently the case in Australia that many government-funded services can only provide 18- 24 months of face-to-face care. No doubt similar services are limited in cash-strapped health systems across the world. Thus solutions need to be found urgently for interventions that supplement face-to-face care during the full period of relapse risk.

These include: • Possible cognitive deficit [14]. Patients with FEP may suffer impairment in speed of processing ranging up to severe [15] and this could indicate a broader diversity of cognitive deficits. However, the severity and pattern of cognitive deficits is unclear, and varies between individuals. • Lack of engagement [16, 17]. Patients with psychotic illness are often difficult to engage. Additionally, many teenagers are protective of their privacy and reluctant to open up to an adult therapist [17]. • Experience of stigma [18, 19].

This problem is particularly severe amongst vulnerable social groups such as adolescents and the socially disadvantaged [20]. • Responsiveness to treatment. Patients with first-episode psychosis are more responsive to treatment compared to patients with more enduring forms of psychosis, and so it is important to develop specific interventions for this phase of the disorder [21].

Thus previous attempts to offer online cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for depression provide a number of lessons for researchers wishing to implement similar treatment for psychosis. In depression studies researchers have found that: a system should be interactive so that users can respond to CBT content through exercises; a system should allow the user to share personal information with a therapist; positive results can be achieved by combining therapy with moderation; a system is preferred by young people when they can see that there are other users, even if they are not connecting directly with them [1].

Psycho-education delivered via the web has been found to be effective when patients spend enough time on the website to complete required modules. However a drawback of online treatments is that many users do not persist in viewing all the available material, and many sites have high dropout rates [5]. In self-guided treatments, with no human moderation, only about 1 in 8 participants have demonstrated clear benefits [2]. 3.2 Online Community Forums Research into user-led services has found robust associations between peer support, empowerment and recovery in people suffering from psychosis [19].

Research with members of online health communities (OHC) shows that members engage in very different levels of disclosure when they are communicating with fellow members of their health community than with their Facebook friends [32]. Newman et al interviewed 14 participants who belonged both to an OHC for weight loss and to Facebook. Participants felt embarrassed to talk about weight issues or discuss their exercise regime with their social group on Facebook and felt their concerns would be met with sarcasm or dismissiveness.

While the work detailed above illustrates robust attempts to use the Internet to support mental health in a variety of ways, there is no prior published research providing a theoretical basis to the use of online therapist-moderated social networking in combination with psychotherapy for treating psychosis.

We propose that clinician- moderated social networking will provide the additional motivation for users to engage. The 6 questions we are investigating are: What user-appropriate system designs can be developed to combine moderator supported psycho-education and social networking in a web-based service?

Patients with FEP may in fact avoid services that force them to acknowledge their connection to this illness group. Because of their low levels of motivation [16] they may also be disinclined to participate in anything new or untried. 4 THEORY AND REQUIREMENTS GATHERING: WHAT MIGHT MOTIVATE SITE USAGE?

While the success of Facebook hinges upon people knowing each other, a website can allow users to hide their identity through pseudonyms and this can encourage higher rates of personal disclosure, which can be therapeutically beneficial. Research suggests that psychosis sufferers like using the Internet because of its anonymity and absence of a hierarchy and its potential to assist in overcoming difficulties with social interaction [13]. The possibility of being anonymous or pseudonymous can allow a person to express their true self [41] while when forced to use their name they"

However, because not all social computing is positive in tone [43] there is a further argument for moderated interventions, even where the opportunity for anonymity exists. 7 4.2 Social Networking, Self-esteem and Positive Psychology Young people with psychosis often suffer from lowered self-esteem. Research suggests that self- esteem may be malleable [33], and this may particularly be the case for young people who not only have long entrenched feelings of low self-esteem but may have been affected by their sudden self-perception as sufferers of mental illness.

Emphasizing the positive can be particularly constructive for patients with only one psychotic episode whose poor self-esteem is not well entrenched. Thus they may be willing to engage with an SNS that has this focus. Using Positive Psychology, individuals whose negative self-concept is refuted in face-to-face therapy have been found to move some way toward changing a negative self-image [33]. Individuals can have a stable self-concept as well as a working self-concept which may be situationally relevant [45].

A need to make sense of one’s illnesses by using the lay knowledge of fellow sufferers may work against the inclination to dissociate from others with mental health problems and instead be an attractor to communication. Research by Hartzler et al [50], outside the mental health context, suggests that fellow patients offer substantial support and expertise that can be quite different to that obtained from professionals. Patients value the expertise of other patients who have had the same illness experience as them.

Others suggest that belonging to a health community can provide opportunities for disclosure, empathic connection, shared goals, and psychological adjustments to life challenges [52] Thus the opportunity to affiliate and make sense of what can be a very confronting and confusing condition could be a compelling pull factor for young people with psychosis to join an SNS of other people in the same situation. 4.4 Supporting Strengths and Accountability Previous work emphasizes the value of providing therapist support in on-line therapy sites.

Clinicians supported the general concept but were concerned about impacts on staff workload and that the system would need to be simple to use to account for cognitive deficit in patients. Using the insights gained at these workshops we designed a web-based system and refined it via a series of prototypes and usability and acceptability trials.

In other health domains, people who use the CSM to help understand their medical condition have been found to be most interested in the effect that their condition has on their everyday life [65, p.904]. This is what compels individuals to stay engaged with online health communities: these provide opportunities to follow the ongoing progress of others.

This further promotes the trust relationship encouraged by SA, as revelation of personal information is known to promote trust [66] and an active user will likely reveal significant information to moderators. Better knowledge of users, in turn, helps alert moderators to early warning signs of relapse so the moderator can take steps to encourage users to initiate preventive measures.

Our trial participants indicated that a key factor that helped them develop trust in our system was that it is connected to a clinic with which they were already familiar.

      "content": "190-195. STATEMENT OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH This paper is related to previous papers that have been published in the Psychiatry literature. In previous work we published data which supported the clinical success of the intervention. The earlier papers do not attempt to theorize about the use of the system and how its design influenced use. The current paper makes three new contributions: It describes in detail the principles used to develop an application for clinician moderation informed by the Supportive Accountability model; it analyzes a large body of qualitative data not dealt with in the previous publications; and it uses a body of theory to explain why users engaged with the system, and why the approach to moderation was successful. This paper explores user-appropriate design for an HCI audience, while our earlier publications addressed a psychiatric audience and focused on the efficacy of the intervention."
