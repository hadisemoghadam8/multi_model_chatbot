This approach to care is increasingly included as a central part of mental health policy and service provision in a number of countries including the UK and Ireland, to address the needs of people who have severe and enduring mental disorders. It is an autonomous, holistic and empowering way of working with individuals as they journey towards healing. Fundamental to this model is the relationship fostered between service users and health professionals. The recovery philosophy of care mirrors some of the core principles of music therapy, including the importance of the therapeutic relationship and the possibilities for change and growth within this.

Keywords Music Therapy, Mental Health, Recovery 3 Introduction Recent and emerging discussion of the recovery approach has been welcomed within the music therapy literature (Kooij, 2009; Grocke, Castle, & Bloch, 2008; Chhina, 2004). This parallels an increase in support for the practice of recovery in mental health care from the service user, carer and service provider community worldwide as promoted by the International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership (IIMHL, 2010). According to the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA, 2010) almost 19% of members practise in the area of mental health. This is similar to figures produced by the Association of Professional Music Therapists (APMT) in the UK where mental health related work accounts for the employment context of approximately 17% of members surveyed (2009).

Music therapy: The evidence The growing evidence base for music therapy in mental health care supports the development of the profession in modern day mental health services. A review of controlled studies concluded that music therapy is “a structured interaction that patients are able to use to participate successfully, manage some of their symptoms, and express feelings relating to their experiences” (Edwards, 2006, p. 33). Lin et al. (2011) reviewed almost 100 studies of music therapy and mental health and concluded that …music as used by music therapists results in clinical improvement. We found no demonstrable evidence that simply listening to music had the same type of result. Therefore, it may be that a purposeful and professional design for delivering music, coupled"

Music therapy is a proven beneficial intervention for people with enduring mental illness which may bring about improvements in social functioning, global state and mental state (Grocke, Castle, & Bloch, 2008). A systematic review of music therapy studies with patients who have schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses concluded that the music therapy intervention, in addition to standard care, could improve patient’s global state (Gold, Heldal, Dahle & Wigram, 2005). Research into music therapy with mental health service users has demonstrated improved symptom scores among those randomised to music therapy, especially in general symptoms of schizophrenia (Talwar, et al., 2006). The effectiveness of music therapy to reduce negative symptoms of schizophrenia has been examined. A randomized control trial showed music therapy increased patients’ ability"

The increasing evidence of the benefits of music therapy that these outcome studies have provided is a driving force for developing music therapy services in the mental health sector.

The recovery approach Described as an idea “whose time has come” (Shepherd, Boardman & Slade, 2008, p. 1) the recovery approach in mental health has become an underpinning feature of mental health policy and service in a number of countries (Shepherd et al., 2008). Based on principles that place the client and their lived experience at the heart of decision making about treatment and care, the recovery approach emphasises hope, meaningful activity and empowerment (Lloyd, Waghorn & Williams, 2008; Shepherd et al., 2008). “Belief that there is hope for a better life is a large part of the recovery orientation” (Lloyd et al., 2008, p. 325).

A person's got to work through emotion. They've got to work through stress. They've got to be able to work through voices and things that are disturbing and destructive to their lives (participant response - Happell, 2008) The recovery approach can be distinguished from what is described as clinical recovery “which implicitly assumes that, in the majority of cases, correct assessment and optimal treatment are sufficient to achieve full symptom remission. This, in turn, enables people to return, mostly without further assistance, to premorbid levels of community functioning.” (Lloyd"

As Davidson, Shahar, Lawless, Sells & Tondora (2006) suggest, recovery is positioned …in contrast to the traditional deficit–based model derived from the clinical discipline of psychopathology, recovery–oriented care is described as eliciting, fleshing out, and cultivating the positive elements of a person’s life—such as his or her assets, aspirations, hopes, and interests. (p. 151) The recovery approach in mental health maps onto a wider perspective in mental health services that has proposed the inclusion of service user voices in reviews of existing programmes and approaches as well as future decision making in policy areas. In Australia for example, an existing policy that standardized outcome measures should be used across all mental health services nationally has been criticised for its failure to include"

As described by one respondent - I think they [services] should have a belief in optimum recovery. I mean, they should look for the best possible outcome (participant response - Happell, 2008). At the same time the central concept of hope has required broader elaboration.

Recovery acknowledges that each person’s journey to wellness is unique and individual. By actively participating in treatment goals and plans people can assume a fulfilled life even when faced with the challenges of mental illness. Recovery promotes hope, positive self- image and identity, trust in self, meaning, relationships, personal resourcefulness, confidence, control and above all else it emphasizes that that the voices of people with mental illness are to be heard and respected (Mental Health Commission, 2007).

Therefore it is timely to consider the possibilities the recovery model offers within music therapy practices internationally. Music therapy can support the call of modern mental health services to reorient towards a more person centred way of working by facilitating individuals’ personal journeys while at the same time fostering respectful, empathic relationships between service users and providers (American Psychiatric Association, 2005; Department of Health and Children, 2006; Mental Health Commission, 2007). Grocke et al. (2008) have suggested that music therapy is “closely aligned to the recovery model of psychiatric care in that its emphasis is on “strengths and resources”(p. 444).

Rolvsjord (2010) proposed that resource oriented music therapy facilitates empowerment, and she distinguishes it from medical or psychoanalytical discourse. This also parallels the goals of the recovery approach that simply following the status quo is not enough to ensure quality care (Borg & Kristiansen, 2004). In the related area of arts activities in mental health, recovery has been presented as facilitated through participation in art making describing it as a strengths based approach (Van Lith, Fenner & Schofield, 2010).

These cases exemplify how music therapy can realise some of the central themes of recovery by responding to the individual wishes and requests of people with enduring mental illness in a way that realises their personal choices, strengths and potentials so that they can reclaim control over their lives. These stories reveal “willingness and ability to shape services to the needs and preferences of each individual service user”, qualities that are essential to recovery-orientated model of care (Borg & Kristiansen, 2004, p. 493).
