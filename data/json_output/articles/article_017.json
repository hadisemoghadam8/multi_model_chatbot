However, due to the high intensity of face-to-face early intervention treatments, this may not be feasible. Adjunctive internet-based interventions speciﬁcally designed for youth may provide a cost-effective and engaging alternative to prevent loss of intervention beneﬁts.

Irrespective of the actual intelligence of the responding bot, there is something distinct about the experience of a user entering input and a bot responding.

Also, beyond the challenge of imbuing chatbots with intelligence in terms of their ability to simulate the structures of natural language communication, another important dimension, particularly in a psychology/therapy setting, is emotional intelligence; developing chatbots that can detect and respond appropriately to the emotional state of the human. Some recent work on emotionally intelligent AI comes from the province of aﬀective computing4 (Brewster, 2016; Skowron et al., 2017). Chatbots are currently a hot topic in the tech world, with major technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Google making signiﬁcant investment forays into this emerging technology.

Whilst our motivations diﬀer, this current commercial interest in chatbots makes for a particularly opportune time to consider their incorporation into online mental health platforms such as MOST. In fact, the history of chatbots is intimately tied with psychology. Apart from the interesting philosophical and psychological questions they raise, the ﬁrst well-established chatbot, ELIZA was actually programmed (in 1966) to simulate a Rogerian psychotherapist (Weizenbaum, 1966). A modern ELIZA, the more sophisticated Artiﬁcial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity (A.L.I.C.E.), ﬁrst surfaced in 1995 (Shah, 2006). Its creation resulted in the development of a general usage Artiﬁcial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML), which can be used to quickly create a basic bot from scratch.

Whilst it could be said that the ultimate goal regarding chatbots is to truly pass the Turing test (Turing, 1950) and convince a human judge that it (the bot) is human (Oppy and Dowe, 2016), our present focus is on using chatbots as conversational search/assistant interfaces. Instead of ﬁnding therapy content via the search box or menus, a chatbot oﬀers an alternative search modality. At its simplest, a chatbot could guide the user in terms of disclosing emotions, therapy preferences and needs. Upon receiving the user’s input, the bot could respond with some suggestions. User experience elements are critical as there are certainly cases where standard search interfaces/apps are a better, more eﬀective choice than chatbots (Verber, 2016). There is however distinct potential in using chatbot searches. A conversational search mode can create a sense of connectivity and personalization that oﬀers a uniquely eﬀective way to collect input"

One other interesting aspect to consider is the extra secondary information that can be obtained from even a few input sentences from the user. As opposed to a static form with pre-deﬁned responses or a search text box that receives one or two word inputs, the input gathered from a conversational search is going to have a richer structure. Linguistic analysis of this input could then contribute to assessing a user’s immediate requirements as well as forming a part of an overall assessment of the user.
