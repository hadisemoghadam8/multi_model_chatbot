VAUGHAN BELL Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, De Crespigny Park, London, UK Abstract Background: Questions have been raised about the internet’s effect on mental health, although no principled review has yet tackled the issue. Aims: To examine the effect of the internet on mental health. Method: Literature review. Results: The internet is typically discussed as if it were a set of activities when it is actually a medium upon which various activities can occur. It is, therefore, neither ‘‘good’’ nor ‘‘bad’’ for mental health, although speciﬁc activities may have an inﬂuence. The standard of mental health information on the internet is probably equivalent to the mainstream media, although overall it still remains poor. The concept of ‘‘internet addiction’’ looks increasingly invalid, although it"

A number of ‘‘extreme communities’’ have formed online, such as pro-anorexia, pro-suicide, pro-amputation and likely- psychotic groups. These serve to provide support, outside a medical and social mainstream that ﬁnds their beliefs and behaviours unacceptable. A review of preliminary randomized controlled trials shows online therapy to be effective for many disorders.

Declaration of interest: None. Keywords: Internet, online, extreme communities, cybertherapy, mental health, e-therapy Introduction The internet is now ubiquitous.

This is also a crucial point when trying to determine the effect of the internet on mental health, as any psychological consequences will depend on the activities that the technology enables, the attributes of the user, and how the two interact (Joinson, 2003). Conceivably, two different computer-enabled activities could both use the internet as a medium of communication, but share no common psychological attributes.

O ne of the most extensively researched online therapeutic applications is MoodGY M (http: / / moodgym.anu.edu.au/ ), a non-therapist web-based CBT package for depression that has generated a large volume of careful research and is open to anyone who wishes to sign up without levying a charge. It has been shown that spontaneous users of the site are typically more depressed than the general population and that depression and anxiety reduces as a result of using the site (Christensen et al., 2002; 2004 b). F urther controlled trials have also shown MoodGY M to be effective when compared to a suitable comparison treatment (Christensen et al., 2004 a; O ’K earney et al., 2006 ),"

It is also clear that outcome is improved as users complete more of the site material (Christensen et al., 2002; 2006 ; O ’K earney et al., 2006 ) although dropout rate is high, with one study reporting that only 7 % of users progressed past the second ‘‘module’’ (Christensen et al., 2006 ). As a result, Christensen and colleagues have repeatedly stressed the need to address such high dropout rates in online therapy. Considering the effects of visual anonymity and text-based communication on group cohesion discussed earlier, the addition of a ‘‘community’’ aspect and perhaps minimal prompts from a therapist might encourage ongoing participation. In fact, minimal prompts have been found to reduce dropout rates, and consequently improve treatment effects, in online therapy for depression (Clarke"

Their study compared a combination of online CBT, minimal therapist contact and web-based discussion group participation, with participation in a discussion group only, and reported both a signiﬁcant positive effect for the treatment group and a completion rate of 8 4 % . Although the numbers in the Andersson study were relatively small, it seems adding some form of ‘‘social motivation’’ might signiﬁcantly reduce dropout rates. Indeed, participation in a depression support group alone was related to a reduction in depressive symptoms in a recent study by Houston et al. (2002), suggesting that both CBT and social support may be important factors in online treatment. O nline therapy for anxiety has also been extensively researched. This has been recently and comprehensively reviewed by Andersson et al."

In their review, Andersson et al. note that evidence for online treatments of panic, phobia, social anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms is promising, although evidence is of a relatively low quality as few large-scale randomized controlled trials have been conducted to test efﬁcacy to gold-standard level. Evidence for online treatment of other complaints is similar, with initially promising results from (generally small) randomized controlled trials for stress-management (Z etterqvist et al., 2003), tinnitus (Andersson et al., 2002; K aldo-S andstrom et al., 2004 ), headache (Andersson et al., 2003; D evineni & Blanchard, 2005 ) chronic back pain (Buhrman et al., 2004 ) and complicated grief (W agner et al., 2006 ).

D espite some proposed guidelines for online therapy (Childress & Asamen, 1 9 9 8 ), the ethical implications of conducting treatment online have not been fully explored. D espite appearances, the internet rarely affords privacy or adequate anonymity (Bell, 2003), and it is unlikely that the maj ority of clinicians are either aware or technically able enough to j udge and ameliorate the risks and should, therefore, seek advice from suitably qualiﬁed computer professionals when designing online clinical interventions.

The maj ority of psychological studies are on text-mediated communication that provides visual anonymity to users. In recent years, graphically rich massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMO R Gs) have become popular, with millions of subscribers now playing regularly.
