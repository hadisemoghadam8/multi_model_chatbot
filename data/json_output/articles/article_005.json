There is widespread support for a positive and lasting relationship between participation in regular exercise and various indices of mental health, and several consensus documents and reviews (e.g. Biddle et al, 2000; Craft & Landers, 1998) have been published in this field.

For instance, a recent overview of depression and its treatment in the UK made no mention the value of exercise (Hale, 1997).

Exercise can be used as a recreational activity as a means to reintroduce individuals into the wider community. This is often an important element of treatment plans for people who have less severe mental health problems. Exercise has the potential to reach a broad audience who might not be able to access other types of psychological interventions or prefer not to use drug- based treatments.

Many drugs also have unpleasant side-effects such as fatigue, cardiovascular complications and even addiction (Martinsen, 1990). Exercise therapy, unlike drugs, requires individuals to become involved in an active rather than a passive rehabilitation process. In other words, drug interventions do no require any physical effort, are externally regulated and participants are passive recipients in the process. In contrast to this, exercise is more internally based and requires participants to experience physical commitment and effort.

This suggests that the primary stimulus for promoting affective change is the elevation in body temperature from exercise, and this alteration in physiological state is manifested in a number of responses that are orchestrated by the hypo- thalamus. The belief that elevating body temperature can be therapeutic is longstanding (e.g. saunas and steam room). Indeed, research has"

Support for the hyperthermic explanation has been mixed and, in fact, there are many studies that have failed to demonstrate a positive relationship between exercise, increases in temperature and improved psychological states. It is now thought that there are more comprehensive models that explain the relationship between physical activity and psychological well-being more accurately.

Self-esteem and mastery explanations There are a number of theoretical models that have attempted to consider the possible relationship between participation in physical activity and self- esteem. One such model is Sonstroem’s (1978) psychological model for physical activity. This model assumes that involvement in physical activity increases physical ability, which positively influences one’s self-estimation and consequently leads to higher levels of self-esteem. Specifically, as individuals with high self-esteem take pride in their bodies, they continue to exercise, thereby maintaining and/or increasing fitness.

This in turn might be effective in changing body perceptions. Related to this, the positive relationship between exercise and mental health could be explained in terms of the physical signs associated with exercise (e.g. muscle tone and weight loss) and these physical signs could be viewed as positive cues towards a sense of achieve- ment in one’s physical self.

In the future, health authorities might wish to pursue the possibility of employing exercise therapists to work alongside clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. Some mental health communities around the UK have exercise scientists within their multi-disciplinary team, although these are limited in numbers. It is not the aim of this paper to suggest that conventional treatments should be abandoned. Rather, it is hoped that this review will encourage psychologists and psychiatrists to be more open to less conventional alternatives so that patients are offered a range of interventions that might include exercise therapy. It is hoped that exercise therapy will become a mechanism by which the body and mind are viewed as dependent, rather than as separate entities, and that over time mental health professionals will begin to accept more readily the benefits of exercise as a therapy.
