Furthermore, an international consortium (Bijl et al., 2003) examined the prevalence rates of treated and untreated mental disorders in ﬁve countries: Canada, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. The largest discrepancies were found for Canada (19.9% of people diagnosed with a DSM-IV disor- der and only 7% seeking treatment in the past year), the United States (29.1% and 10.9%) and the Netherlands (24.4% and 13.4%). Research on procrastination and physical health (Sirois, 2007; Sirois, Melia-Gordon, & Pychyl, 2003) suggests an investigation of procrastination as both a possible contributor to ailment and a behavioural barrier to treatment in the mental health domain. 1.1.

Trait pro- crastination is the predisposition to postpone that which is necessary to reach some goal (Lay, 1986). The current study exam- ines trait procrastination on academic and everyday tasks as it re- lates to mental health and help-seeking. Procrastination has been linked to many negative mental health states. Anxiety and depres- sion are positively correlated with self-report and behavioural measures of procrastination (Beswick, Rothblum, & Mann, 1988; Martin, Flett, Hewitt, Krames, & Szanto, 1996). Stress and mental health have been repeatedly found to vary in- versely (e.g., DeLongis, Lazarus, & Folkman, 1988) and with likely reciprocal inﬂuence (Hammen, 2005).

In a student sample, all participants re- ported experiencing stress resulting from procrastination (Schraw, Wadkins, & Olafson, 2007). Procrastinating online was also linked to perceived stress relief (Lavoie & Pychyl, 2001). The relation be- tween procrastination and stress may vary depending on the urgency of the stressor. Tice and Baumeister (1997) found that stu- dents who procrastinated at the beginning of a semester experi- enced less stress and fewer illness symptoms. However, at the end of a semester, with deadlines and examinations looming, procrasti- nators tended to have greater stress, more illness symptoms, more 0191-8869/$ - see front matter \u0002 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Procrastination, stress and treatment delay Individual differences in personality are related to help-seeking for emotional problems (Rickwood & Braithwaite, 1994). More spe- ciﬁcally, procrastination acts as a barrier to help-seeking for drug abuse (McCoy, Metsch, Chitwood, & Miles, 2001) and gambling (Bellringer, Pulford, Abbott, DeSouza, & Clarke, 2008). Procrastina- tion may thus be a barrier to help-seeking for other mental health concerns.

Analyses in a subsequent replication generalized original ﬁndings to a community-dwelling adult sample (Sirois, 2007). Consistent with the previous ﬁndings, procrastination was associated with higher stress, more acute health problems, and the practice of fewer wellness behaviours. Procrastinators also reported less frequent household safety behaviours and dental and medical check-ups. In this study (Sirois, 2007), stress fully mediated the procrastination-health relationship. Initially, health behaviours also appeared to mediate the procrastination-health relationship.

A control analysis on a dichotomized MHB scale did not substantially impact results. Large sample size reduces the undesirable impact of kurtosis and skew and canonical correlation analysis tends to be robust to vio- lations of parametric assumptions (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). Consequently, the MHB scale’s original format was retained. 3.2.

The relation between greater daily stress severity and poorer mental health is very strong. These factors are heavily represented in the ﬁrst canonical function. In fact, the cognitive functioning subscale of mental health loads almost fully (\u0002.98) onto the linear aggregate of criterion variables in CF-I. It appears that cognitive functioning may have a role in stress management that is proﬁt- ably distinguished from mental health generally. Inasmuch as stress may ‘‘compromise its own negotiation” (Neufeld, 1990), appropriate decision-making under stress may be affected by cog- nitive load as a stressor"

The relation between stress and mental health (including cognitive functioning), rather than procrastination and mental health behav- iours, were the driving factors of this function. Positing stress as a level of environmental demands on the organism (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; c.f. Neufeld, 1990), it may be that when external demands exceed an organism’s resources, or, ability to cope, men- tal illness itself may be a chaotic, haphazard, ad hoc response to what is perceived as an impossible situation. Preservation of some degree of effective cognitive functioning may be implicated with treatment-seeking. Unlike the procrastination measures which vary together in each of the three canonical functions, the CF-6 subscale of the MHI-38 behaves differently between canonical functions from its MHI-32 counterpart. This recommends future investigation of the hypothesis that effective cognitive functioning is a factor in the mental health help-seeking picture. Although the main hypotheses"

For example, in CF-III procrastination was shown to be associated with better mental health. However, in CF-I the expected association between high procrastination and poorer mental health was obtained. The action in concert of each important loading must be considered, as has been discussed above. The pattern of increased procrastination and better men- tal health status may also suggest that procrastination can act as a temporarily adaptive, avoidance coping-related buffer. Over a prolonged period of time, however, procrastination is detrimen- tal to one’s mental health (e.g., Martin et al., 1996; Tice & Bau- meister, 1997). Examining the directionality of the canonical loadings for procrastination and cognitive functioning reveals a tendency towards functioning in opposite directions. In Table 1, procrasti- nation and cognitive functioning are associated with a robust moderate negative relation. This suggests that"

Related research has argued that cognitive functioning can be theoretically related to procrastination (Shanahan & Pychyl, 2007) and goal-oriented attention control has been found empirically to be negatively related to procrastination (Steel, 2002). Finally, two of three control variables, age and gender, clustered as ‘‘drivers” for CF-II, onto which mental health behaviour loaded heavily. It appears that older and female participants were much more likely to seek mental health help. This may be a more prom- ising avenue of research into interventions to foster increased overall rates of help-seeking behaviour, for example, by targeting males when publicizing campus mental health services, or by tar- geting more junior students. 4.1.

Socially desirable responding was measured and correlated weakly with procrastination, stress, and mental health. It registered just below a common cut-off point (.48, standard cut-off of .50) in CF-III, but did not substan- tially alter ﬁndings. The canonical correlation analysis jointly assessed the effects of procrastination and stress on mental health and help-seeking, making it difﬁcult to delineate their individual effects. However, the three signiﬁcant canonical functions parceled out the variance in such a way that the individual relation between the variables could be detected, providing some preliminary insight into their individual contributions to mental health and help-seeking. For the mental health focus of this study, we utilized the MHB questions modeled after the health care behaviours ques- tions of Sirois (2007). Results on these questions"

Nonetheless, large sample size and the robustness of a canonical correlation analy- sis to violations of normality support the validity of the results. Future versions of the scale could include sub-clinical mental health wellness behaviours (e.g., ‘‘I go for a walk when I’m stressed.”) in order to reliably produce a normal distribution. Additionally, the help-seeking behaviour questions did not in- clude a speciﬁcation of the presence or absence of a mental health issue. This may confound participants who have not sought help because of the lack of a mental health issue with participants who have a mental health issue but have not sought help because of other factors (such as procrastination or stress).

Implications and conclusions The present study provided evidence that the documented asso- ciations of procrastination and stress on physical health and treat- ment-seeking can be extended to the domain of mental health. High levels of trait procrastination and daily stress are maladap- tive, being associated with poorer mental health and, with some qualiﬁcations, a lack of mental health help-seeking. Although the strong connection between stress and poorer mental health is by no means a new ﬁnding, the problematic impediment of trait pro- crastination can now be veriﬁably incorporated within this picture. Our ﬁndings suggest that procrastinators, younger people, males, and those inﬂuenced by social desirability concerns are more likely to be impeded from seeking help with mental health concerns. There may also be fruitful avenues of research on the interaction of cognitive functioning, mental health, and treatment-seeking. A crucial question arises: If"
