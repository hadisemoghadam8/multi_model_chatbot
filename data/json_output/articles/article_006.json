Psychiatrists in partic- ular are being pressured to offer less psychotherapy, pre- scribe more drugs, and focus on 15-minute “med checks,” a pressure that psychologists who obtain prescription priv- ileges will doubtless also face (Mojtabai & Olfson, 2008). As a result, patients suffer from inattention to complex psychodynamic and social factors, and therapists can suffer painful cognitive dissonance and role strain when they shortchange patients who need more than what is allowed by mandated brief treatments (Luhrmann, 2001). A further cost of current therapeutic trends is the underestimation and underutilization of lifestyle treatments (Angell, 2009) despite considerable evidence of their ef- fectiveness. In fact, the need for lifestyle treatments is growing, because unhealthy behaviors such as overeating and lack of exercise are increasing to such an extent that the World Health Organization (2008, para. 1) warned that “an escalating global epidemic of"

TLCs can be used alone or adjunctively and are often accessible and affordable; many can be introduced quickly, some- times even in the ﬁrst session (McMorris, Tomporowski & Audiffren, 2009). TLCs have few negatives. Unlike both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, they are free of stigma and can even confer social beneﬁts and social esteem (Borgonovi, 2009). In addition, they have fewer side effects and complications than medications (Amminger et al., 2010). TLCs offer signiﬁcant secondary beneﬁts to patients, such as improvements in physical health, self-esteem, and quality of life (Deslandes et al., 2009). Furthermore, some TLCs—for example, exercise, diet, and meditation—may also be neuroprotective and reduce the risk of subsequent age-related cognitive losses and corresponding neural shrinkage (Hamer & Chida, 2009; Pagnoni & Cekic, 2007; Raji"

Many TLCs not only reduce psychopathology but can also enhance health and well-being. For example, medita- tion can be therapeutic for multiple psychological and psychosomatic disorders (Chiesa, 2009; Didonna, 2009; Shapiro & Carlson, 2009). Yet it can also enhance psycho- logical well-being and maturity in normal populations and can be used to cultivate qualities that are of particular value to clinicians, such as calmness, empathy, and self-actual- ization (Shapiro & Carlson, 2009; Walsh, 2011; Walsh & Shapiro, 2006). Knowledge of TLCs can beneﬁt clinicians in several ways. Utilizing TLCs may result in greater clinical ﬂexi- bility and effectiveness and less role strain.

There are also entrepreneurial opportunities. Clinics are needed that offer systematic lifestyle programs for mental health that are similar to current programs for reversing coronary artery disease (Pischke et al., 2008). For societies, TLCs may offer signiﬁcant community and economic advantages. Economic beneﬁts can accrue from reducing the costs of lifestyle-related disorders such as obesity, which alone accounts for over $100 billion in costs in the United States each year (World Health Orga- nization, 2008). Community beneﬁts can occur both di- rectly through enhanced personal relationships and service (Post, 2007) and indirectly through social networks.

So what lifestyle changes warrant consideration? Con- siderable research and clinical evidence support the follow- ing eight TLCs: exercise, nutrition and diet, time in nature, relationships, recreation, relaxation and stress manage- ment, religious and spiritual involvement, and contribution and service to others.

The most studied disorder in relation to exercise to date is mild to moderate depression. Cross-sectional, pro- spective, and meta-analytic studies suggest that exercise is both preventive and therapeutic, and in terms of therapeutic beneﬁts it compares favorably with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (Dowd et al., 2004; Sidhu et al., 2009). Both aerobic exercise and nonaerobic weight training are effec- tive for both short-term interventions and long-term main- tenance, and there appears to be a dose–response relation- ship, with higher intensity workouts being more effective.

Proposed physiological mediators in- clude changes in serotonin metabolism, improved sleep, as well as endorphin release and consequent “runner’s high” (Deslandes et al., 2009; Stathopoulou et al., 2006). Psycho- logical factors include enhanced self-efﬁcacy and self- esteem, interruption of negative thoughts and rumination (Dowd et al., 2004), and perhaps the breakdown of mus- cular armor, the chronic psychosomatic muscle tension patterns that express emotional conﬂicts and are a focus of somatic therapies (Smith, 2000). Neural factors are especially intriguing. Exercise in- creases brain volume (both gray and white matter), vascu- larization, blood ﬂow, and functional measures (Erickson & Kramer, 2009; Hamer & Chida, 2009).

Given these neural effects, it is not surprising that exercise can also confer signiﬁcant cognitive beneﬁts (Mc- Morris et al., 2009).

Multiple studies show that exercise is a valuable therapy for Alzheimer’s patients that can improve intellectual capacities, social functions, emotional states, and caregiver distress (Christofoletti, Oliani, Gobbi, & Stella, 2007; Deslandes et al., 2009). Meta-analytic studies provide more ﬁne-grained de- tails about the cognitive beneﬁts of exercise for the elderly and offer four kinds of good news.

Fourth, executive functions, such as coordination and planning, appear to beneﬁt most, a welcome ﬁnding given that executive func- tions are so important, and that both they and the brain areas that underlie them are particularly age sensitive (Col- combe & Kramer, 2003; Erickson & Kramer, 2009). Finally, meta-analyses reveal the speciﬁc elements of exercise that beneﬁt cognition. Relatively short programs of one to three months in length offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts, though programs of six months or longer are more beneﬁ- cial.

Fortunately, even brief counseling can motivate many patients to exercise (Long et al., 1996), and the risks are minimal, although an initial medical exam may be war- ranted. Yet despite the many mental and medical beneﬁts of exercise, only some 10% of mental health professionals recommend it. And who are these 10%?

Supplements Growing evidence suggests that food supplements offer valuable prophylactic and therapeutic beneﬁts for mental health. Research is particularly being directed to Vitamin D, folic acid, SAME (S-adenosyl-methionine), and—most of all—ﬁsh oil (Sarris, Schoendorfer, & Kavanagh, 2009). Fish and ﬁsh oil are especially important for mental health. They supply essential omega-3 fatty acids, espe- cially EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosa- hexaenoic acid), which are essential to neural function. Systemically, omega-3s are anti-inﬂammatory, counteract the pro-inﬂamatory effects of omega-6 fatty acids, and are protective of multiple body systems. Unfortunately, mod- ern diets are often high in omega-6s and deﬁcient in omega-3s (Freeman et al., 2006). Is this dietary deﬁciency associated with psychopa- thology?

However, epidemiological studies of dementia and omega-3 fatty acid intake are as yet inconclusive (Freeman et al., 2006). Epidemiological, cross-sectional, and clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may be therapeutic for several disorders. Again, depression has been the disorder most closely studied (Stahl, Begg, Weis- inger, & Sinclair, 2008).

For example, the views of one level are taken as normative, and those at this level tend to assume that people at other levels are mistaken, misguided, malev- olent, or disturbed (Wilber, 2005).

The world’s major spiritual tradi- tions emphasize that, when viewed correctly, service is not necessarily a sacriﬁce but rather can foster qualities that serve the giver—such as happiness, mental health, and spiritual maturity. Altruism is said to reduce unhealthy mental qualities such as greed, jealousy, and egocentricity while enhancing healthy qualities such as love, joy, and generosity (Hopkins, 2001; Walsh, 1999). The beneﬁts of service are also said to extend to healing, such that healing oneself and others can be intimately linked. Multiple myths and healing traditions describe wounded healers, people who by"

The so-called “paradox of happiness” is that spend- ing one’s time and resources on others can make one happier (Walsh, 1999).

Erik Erikson (1959) famously suggested that “generativity” (care and concern for others, and espe- cially for future generations) may be a hallmark of suc- cessful maturation. Moreover, altruism has a positive social contagion or multiplier effect. For example, cooperative behaviors cascade through social networks to induce fur- ther cooperation in others (J. H. Fowler & Christakis, 2010), and at the community level, service is a key con- tributor to social capital (Putnam, 2000). In summary, considerable research shows positive re- lationships between altruistic behavior and multiple mea- sures of psychological, physical, and social well-being. However, there are important qualiﬁers. Major exceptions include the caretaker burnout experienced by overwhelmed family members caring for a"

Whereas service motivated by pleasure in helping is associated with multiple positive measures (such as positive affect, self-esteem, self-actual- ization, and life satisfaction), this association may not hold when service is driven by a sense of internal pressure, duty, and obligation (Gebauer, Riketta, Broemer, & Mai, 2008). Psychotherapists repeatedly rediscover the healing po- tentials of altruistic behavior for both their patients and themselves. Alfred Adler emphasized the beneﬁts of “so- cial interest,” and helping other group members contributes to the effectiveness of group therapy and support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (Duncan et al., 2009). Likewise, therapists often report that helping their patients can enhance their own well-being (Yalom, 2002). Wisely perceived, altruism is not self-sacriﬁce but rather enlight- ened self-interest (Walsh, 1999). As the Dalai Lama put it, “If you’re going to be selﬁsh,"

These beneﬁts of altruism hold major implications for our understanding of health, lifestyle, and therapy. On the basis of their research ﬁndings, Brown, Nesse, Vinokur, and Smith (2003) wrote an article titled “Providing Social Support May Be More Beneﬁcial Than Receiving It” and concluded that interventions “designed to help people feel supported may need to be redesigned so that the emphasis is on what people do to help others” (p. 326). Other researchers quipped, “If giving weren’t free, pharmaceuti- cal companies could herald the discoveries of a stupendous new drug called ‘Give Back’—instead of ‘Prozac’” (Post & Niemark, 2007, p. 7).

Discussion A culture’s technology has far-reaching effects on people’s psychology and lifestyles (Wilber, 2000), and modern tech- nology is now affecting our psychology, biology, society, and lifestyles in ways we are only beginning to compre- hend. Moreover, technological innovations and their life- style effects are changing “more quickly than we know how to change ourselves” (Putnam, 2000, p. 402). Many of the resultant costs are doubtless as yet unrecognized, and this raises a disconcerting question: Could some of our patients be “canaries in the coal mine,” warning us of ways of life that may exact a toll on us all? This is a question that health professionals will need to confront increasingly as technological, environmental, and lifestyle changes accel- erate.

For example, physical activity increases neuronogenesis in the rat hippocampus. However, the ef- fect is maximal only when the animals are exposed to a rich social environment rather than living in isolation (Strana- han, Khalil, & Gould, 2006). Similarly, in his program to reverse coronary arteriosclerosis, Dean Ornish employed four TLCs—exercise, vegetarian diet, relaxation and stress management, and social support. Each proved beneﬁcial, and the effects were additive (Pischke et al., 2008). Might this also be true for psychological disorders? Quite possi- bly, but as yet we have no clear answer.

Patients often have little social support, little understanding of causal lifestyle factors, and a passive expectation that healing comes from an outside authority or a pill (Duncan et al., 2009). Societally, whole industries are geared toward encouraging unhealthy choices. Patients contend with a daily barrage of psychologically sophisti- cated advertisements encouraging them, for example, to consume alcohol, nicotine, and fast food in the never- ending search for what the food industry calls the “bliss point” of “eatertainment” through “hypereating” (Kessler, 588 October 2011 ●American Psychologist This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

The ﬁrst is simply to become familiar with the large literature on TLCs. The second is a professional bias toward pharmacological and formal psychotherapeutic interventions. In addition, foster- ing patients’ TLCs can be time intensive, can demand considerable therapeutic skill, and is not well reimbursed. Therapists may also harbor negative expectations (not without some justiﬁcation) that patients will not maintain the necessary changes. However, it is crucial to be aware of the Rosenthal effect: the self-fulﬁlling power of interper- sonal expectations. Finally, cognitive dissonance may be at work when therapists’ own lifestyles are unhealthy (McEn- tee & Halgin, 1996).

As long ago as 1915, a sociologist observed that “the continued performance of a certain profession or trade creates in the individual a de- formation of the reasoning process. . . . such deformation is largely a matter of adaptation to environment” (Langerock, 1915). Professional deformation can be extreme. Consider, for example, the forced psychiatric hospitalization and drugging of Soviet dissidents by Soviet mental health pro- fessionals who believed that the counterconventional be- liefs of these “patients” were diagnostic of “sluggish schizophrenia” (van Voren, 2002). However, more subtle forms of professional deforma- tion may be more pervasive and more difﬁcult to recognize.

An obvious question then becomes: Does the widespread underemphasis on lifestyle factors across mental health professions constitute a further example of professional deformation? Are there additional therapeutic lifestyle factors? Cer- tainly, and examples range from sleep hygiene to ethics, community engagement, and the moderating of television viewing, all of which have demonstrated mental health beneﬁts (Ito et al., 2008; Preiss et al., 2006; Putnam, 2000; Walsh, 1999).
