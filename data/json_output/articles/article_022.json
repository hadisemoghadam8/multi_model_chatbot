The sample included six peer- nominated experienced therapists, trained at the masters or doctoral level, who self-identified as having managed well in this work. Narrative data was collected through interviews with individual co-participants, who were asked, \"How do you manage to sustain your personal and professional wellbeing, given the challenges of your work with seriously traumatized clients?\" Data analysis was based upon Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach, and Zilber's (1998) typology"

The novel finding that empathic engagement with traumatized clients appeared to be protective challenges previous conceptualizations of VT and points to exciting new directions for research and theory, as well as applications to practice.

The risks of working directly with traumatized individuals on a regular basis are well documented within the literature. Counsellors and other mental health professionals may experience physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms, (e.g. physical pain and agitation, emotional distress, disrupted beliefs, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts and images) similar to those of their traumatized clients (Arvay, 2001; Figley, 2002; McCann & Pearlman, 1990; Sexton, 1999).

To date, very little is known about the success and satisfaction of trauma therapists who are able to manage in the workplace despite the potentially noxious demands of their work. Who are the respected, experienced professionals who succeed in this work and remain healthy? How and why do they carry on?

The purpose of the study was to gain and share knowledge about these protective practices. The ultimate goal of the study is to contribute to the prevention of VT. This research has implications for the training, counselling practice, supervision, and support of counsellors who are working with increasingly complex client populations.

When individuals trained in the helping professions abandon the field, due to a perceived burden of caring and an insufficient ability to balance work with other aspects of life, this constitutes an enormous loss of resources and potential. When therapists continue working, despite suffering from the damaging effects of VT, this constitutes a tremendous disservice to both clients and helpers, and the health of our community is undermined. It was imperative to address these concerns on ethical grounds, as practitioners and researchers alike must strive to provide appropriate, effective care for traumatized clients as well as those who work with them. There is a social cost to ignoring these issues.

Research Design I used a narrative method of inquiry and analysis to explore these research questions (Arvay, 2003, Freeman, 1997, McLeod, 2001). This approach to research involves \"in-depth study of particular individuals in social context and in time\" (Josselson, 2003, p.4), and integrates a careful, systematic study of phenomena with the literary deconstruction of texts and hermeneutic analyses of meanings. Narrative analysis combines a discursive emphasis on how meanings are constructed through language and utterances along with an attention to the participant's personal agency and self-awareness in their efforts to attribute meaning and achieve fulfillment in their lives. It is concerned with the multiplicity of voices within texts, the co- constructed nature of interviews, figurative use of language,"

Vicarious Traumatization Over the past 15 years, researchers and theorists have given increasing attention to the construct of Vicarious Traumatization (VT), defined by Pearlman and Mac Ian (1995) as \"the transformation that occurs within the therapist (or trauma worker) as a result of empathic engagement with clients' trauma experiences and their sequelae\" (p. 558). McCann and Pearlman (1990) first identified and conceptualized VT as an interactive, cumulative, and inevitable process, distinct from burnout or conntertransference. They posited that all therapists working with survivors of trauma experience pervasive and enduring alterations in cognitive schema that impact the trauma worker's feelings, relationships, and life. Whether these changes are destructive to the therapist and to the therapeutic process, depends, according to these authors, largely on the extent to which the helper is able to engage in her or his own process of integration and transformation of clients' horrific traumatic material.

Furthermore, the therapist is the locus of origin for countertransference, which is based upon preexisting personal characteristics of the helper (inner qualities, psychological makeup, etc.) and is understood to be an intrusion of a therapist's own unresolved material, including previous trauma experiences, retaliatory or aggressive fantasies, etc. In contrast, traumatic experiences in the client's life account for therapist VT.

Hence burnout would be the ultimate common pathway for VT, because over closeness eventually is unsustainable and leads to distancing. According to Pearlman and Saakvitne (1995b), VT arises out of the interaction between a therapist's characteristics and the work environment over time. Both the nature of trauma work and personal characteristics of individual therapists contribute to vicarious traumatization of therapists. The latter include: therapists' high ideals, over-identification with clients, over- investment in meeting clients' every need, rescue fantasies, inadequate self-care, and inadequate training and supervision, all of which can contribute to VT.

In their review of the literature, Pearlman and Mac Ian (1995) also reported Schauben and Frazier's finding that a larger number of directly traumatized clients on a therapist's caseload was correlated with more severe disruptions in schemas/beliefs, increased PTSD symptoms, and increased likelihood of self-identifying as experiencing VT.

In the case of STSD, the primary exposure to traumatic events by one person becomes the traumatizing event for the second person.

This finding surprised me, because I went into the research thinking that empathic engagement was a risk factor rather than a protective practice. However, when therapists maintain clarity about interpersonal boundaries, when they are able to get very close without fusing or confusing the client's story, experiences, and perspective with their own, this exquisite kind of empathic attunement is nourishing for therapist and client alike, in part because the therapists recognize it is beneficial to the clients. Thus the ability to establish a deep, intimate, therapeutic alliance based upon presence, heartfelt concern, and love is an important aspect of professional satisfaction for many of these trauma therapists.

In this way, mindful self-awareness both facilitates these therapists' ability to engage in their work as a practice of their personal spirituality and contributes to their professional satisfaction. To me, this is beautiful and profound. Of course mindfulness practice also helps them to become aware of counter transference or salient self schema and ensuing \"needs\" that might put clinicians at increased risk for VT, as described by McCann and Pearlman (1990); however, it encompasses much more than this or the kind of self-awareness with regard to potential impairment"

Personally, I appreciate that these exemplary therapists' sense of connection to the transcendent was expressed in terms of an openness to the unknown, rather than through a more simplistic or reductive storying of the spiritual realm that might have come at the expense of cognitive complexity. Indeed, throughout the research conversations, participants' efforts to describe their connection to the transcendent eluded definition and narrativization. Instead, this elusive realm was described as having been tacitly known, in a way that eclipsed language. For me, this was a rich and heartening finding: Encountering the limits of the known and knowable need not be daunting or distressing. Rather, not knowing can be reassuring, in and of itself, when it comes to the meta-theoretical and metaphysical.

Further research is needed to explore whether there are differences within the subgroup of trauma therapists who have experienced personal trauma (i.e., between those who experienced PTG and those whose are still struggling with unresolved emotions related to their personal history of trauma).

Implications for Practice The findings from the current study have important implications for training and practice in trauma therapy, as well as for the treatment of VT. This research suggests that effective, protective empathic engagement with traumatized clients involves neither over-identification with nor avoidance of clients' traumatic material.

Additionally, findings about the important role that supervision and therapist self-care play in mitigating the risks of VT may be particularly helpful to counsellor education programs in their training of students. Similarly these findings could help inform the decision making processes of community agencies with regard to how to best support clinical staff, and also be highly beneficial to individuals in private practice.
