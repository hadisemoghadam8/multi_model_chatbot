It comes from a root word meaning ‘by chance’ or ‘an occurrence’, which in a positive sense connotes a sense of newness, wonder, and appreciation of chance occurrences. The irony is that people not only seek it, they try to hold on to it—especially to avoid any sense of ‘unhappiness’. Unfortunately, these very control efforts can become heavy, planned, closed, rigid and fixed. Happiness is not just a matter of feeling good. If it were, drug abusers would be the happiest people on the planet. Indeed, feeling good can be a very unhappy pursuit. It is not by accident that drug users call their methods of doing so a ‘fix’—because they"

In the name of producing an emotional result we call happiness, most of us tend to engage in behaviour that is the exact opposite and then feel awful and inadequate with the inevitable result. Until we wise up, we are all generally trying to get a ‘fix’ on happiness. This book is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is an empirically supported approach that takes a new and unexpected tack in dealing with the issue of happiness and life satisfaction. Instead of teaching new techniques to pursue happiness, ACT teaches ways to undermine struggle, avoidance, and loss of the moment. Russ Harris has very carefully and creatively presented this approach in an accessible way. In 33 bite-sized chapters"

I’m not posing these questions just to grab your attention. This book is based on a growing body of scientific research that suggests we are all caught in a powerful psychological trap. We lead our lives ruled by many unhelpful and inaccurate beliefs about happiness—ideas widely accepted by society because ‘everyone knows they are true’.

ACT has also proved highly effective for the less dramatic problems that millions of us encounter, such as quitting smoking and reducing stress in the workplace. Unlike the vast majority of other therapies, ACT has a firm basis in scientific research and, because of this, it is rapidly growing in popularity among psychologists all around the world.

These statistics give us the answer, loud and clear: happiness is not normal! Why Is It So Difficult To Be Happy? To answer this question, we need to take a journey back in time. The modern human mind, with its amazing ability to analyse, plan, create and communicate, has largely evolved over the last hundred thousand years, since our species, Homo sapiens, first appeared on the planet. But our minds did not evolve to make us feel good, so we could tell great jokes, write sonnets and say ‘I love you’. Our minds evolved to help us survive in a world fraught with danger. Imagine that you’re an early human hunter-gatherer. What are your essential needs in order to survive and reproduce?"

So the number one priority of the primitive human mind was to look out for anything that might harm you and avoid it! In essence, the primitive mind was a ‘Don’t get killed’ device, and it proved enormously useful. The better our ancestors became at anticipating and avoiding danger, the longer they lived and the more children they had. With each generation the human mind became increasingly skilled at predicting and avoiding danger. And now, after a hundred thousand years of evolution, the modern mind is still constantly on the lookout for trouble. It assesses and judges almost everything we encounter: Is this good or bad? Safe or dangerous? Harmful or helpful? These days, though, it’s not sabre-toothed cats or 200 kilogram wolves that our mind warns us about. Instead"

No matter how hard we try to hold on to them, they slip away every time. And as we shall see, a life spent in pursuit of those feelings is, in the main, unsatisfying. In fact, the harder we pursue pleasurable feelings, the more we are likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. The other meaning of happiness is ‘a rich, full and meaningful life’.

Myth No.1: Happiness Is The Natural State For All Human Beings Our culture insists that humans are naturally happy. But the statistics quoted in the introduction clearly disprove this. Remember, one in ten adults will attempt suicide, and one in five will suffer from depression. What’s more, the statistical probability that you will suffer from a psychiatric disorder at some stage in your life is almost 30 per cent! Not exactly great odds, are they?

Myth No.2: If You’re Not Happy, You’re Defective Following logically from Myth 1, western society assumes that mental suffering is abnormal. It is seen as a weakness or illness, a product of a mind that is somehow faulty or defective. This means that when we do inevitably experience painful thoughts and feelings, we often criticise ourselves for being weak or stupid. Health professionals contribute to this process by readily slapping on labels such as, ‘You’re depressed’, and these labels merely confirm how defective we are.

And what does that society tell us to do? To eliminate ‘negative’ feelings and accumulate ‘positive’ ones in their place. It’s a nice theory and on the surface it seems to make sense. After all, who wants to have unpleasant feelings? But here’s the catch: the things we generally value most in life bring with them a whole range of feelings, both pleasant and unpleasant.

However, in Part 2 of this book, you will learn how to handle such feelings altogether differently, to experience them in such a way that they bother you a whole lot less.

Other approaches encourage the repetition of positive affirmations such as, ‘Everything that happens is for my highest good and greatest joy’, or ‘I am strong, able and capable at all times’.

How We Learn About Control From a young age, we are taught that we should be able to control our feelings. When you were growing up, you probably heard a number of expressions like, ‘Don’t cry, or I’ll give you something to cry about’, ‘Don’t be so gloomy; look on the bright side’, ‘Take that frown off your face’, ‘You’re a big boy now. Big boys don’t cry’, ‘Stop feeling sorry for yourself’, ‘Don’t worry, there’s no need to be frightened.’ With words such as these, the adults around us sent out the message, again and again, that we ought to be able to control our feelings.

However they were coping, they probably didn’t share those experiences with you. And on those rare occasions when you did get to witness their loss of control, they probably never said anything like, ‘Okay, these tears are because I’m feeling something called sadness. It’s a normal feeling and you can learn how to handle it effectively.’ But then, that’s not too surprising; they couldn’t show you how to handle your emotions because they didn’t know how to handle theirs!

The implication of all these phrases is that you should be able to turn your feelings on and off at will, like flicking a switch. And why is this myth so compelling? Because the people around us seem, on the surface, to be happy. They seem to be in control of their thoughts and feelings. But ‘seem’ is the key word here.

PRINCIPLE 1: DEFUSION Defusion means relating to your thoughts in a new way, so they have much less impact and influence over you. As you learn to defuse painful and unpleasant thoughts, they will lose their ability to frighten, disturb or depress you. And as you learn to defuse unhelpful thoughts, such as self-limiting beliefs and harsh self-criticisms, they will have much less influence over your behaviour. PRINCIPLE 2: EXPANSION Expansion means making room for unpleasant feelings, sensations and urges, instead of trying to suppress them or push them away. As you open up and make space for these feelings, you will find they bother you much less, and they ‘move on’ much more rapidly, instead of ‘hanging a round’ and disturbing you. (The official"

(The official ACT term for this principle is ‘Contact With The Present Moment’. I have changed the term in this book purely for ease of communication.) PRINCIPLE 4: THE OBSERVING SELF The Observing Self is a powerful aspect of human consciousness, which has been largly ignored by western psychology until now. As you learn how to access this part of yourself, it will enable you to further transform your relationship with unwanted thoughts and feelings.

But not just any action. It happens through effective action, guided by and motivated by your values. And in particular, it happens through committed action: action that you take again, and again, and again, no matter how many times you fail, or go off track.

We all have beliefs, but the more tightly we hold on to them, the more inflexible we become in our attitudes and behaviours. If you’ve ever tried having an argument with someone who absolutely believes they are right, then you know how pointless it is—they will never see any point of view other than their own.

The impostor thinks of himself as a fraud, a fake, a charlatan, bluffing his way through everything, always on the verge of being ‘found out’. In the impostor syndrome, people are not paying enough attention to their direct experience; to the clearly observable facts that they are doing their job effectively.

Once you have a firm foothold, you can take the next step more effectively. The more fully you accept the reality of your situation—as it is, here and now—the more effectively you can take action to change it. The Dalai Lama exemplifies this beautifully. He fully accepts that China has invaded Tibet and that he is forced to live in exile from his own country. He doesn’t waste time and energy in wishful thinking, getting outraged or dwelling morosely on what he’s lost. He knows that won’t help. Nor does he admit defeat"

Defusion is not some clever way to control your feelings. It’s simply an acceptance technique. True, defusing unhelpful thoughts will often reduce feelings of anxiety, but that’s just a beneficial byproduct; a bonus—it’s not the main thing.

For example, many people avoid air travel because their minds conjure up images of the plane crashing. In cognitive fusion, we: • take these images seriously • give them all our attention • react to them as if they are actually happening • treat them as if they are an accurate prediction of the future. In cognitive defusion we: • recognise that images are nothing more than pictures • pay"

Once we recognise this, we can let them be there without fighting them, without judging them and without trying to avoid them. In other words, we can accept them.

Chapter 9 DEMONS ON THE BOAT Imagine you’re steering a ship far out at sea. Below the deck, out of sight, lies a vast horde of demons, all with enormous claws and razor- sharp teeth. These demons have many different forms. Some of them are emotions such as guilt, anger, fear or hopelessness. Some are memories of times you’ve failed, screwed up or been hurt. Others are thoughts like, ‘It’s too hard’, ‘I’ll make a fool of myself’ or ‘I’ll fail.’ Some of them are mental images in which you see yourself performing badly or getting rejected; others are strong urges"

Not surprisingly, you don’t like that very much, so you cut a deal: ‘If you demons stay out of sight, down below, I’ll keep the ship drifting out at sea.’ The demons agree and everything seems okay—for a while.

These physical changes prepare us to take action. Physical changes in the body may include alterations in heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tone, circulation and hormone levels, as well as the activation of different parts of the nervous system. We notice these changes as sensations, such as ‘butterflies’ in the stomach, a ‘lump’ in the throat, watering eyes or clammy hands. We also notice them as urges to act in a particular way, such as to cry, laugh or hide. Emotions influence us to act in different ways. For"

A tendency means we have the inclination to do something; it doesn’t mean we have to do it, that we have no choice. It doesn’t mean we are forced or compelled to act in a particular way; it just means we tend to act that way. So, for example, if you’re anxious about running late, you may have the tendency to drive above the speed limit, but you can still choose to drive legally and safely if you wish.

The word ‘emotion’ is derived from the Latin exmovere, meaning to ‘move out’ or ‘excite’, and many of the names we give to our emotions are derived from ancient words for physical sensations.

You may have the tendency to shout, grimace, clench your fists or lash out physically or verbally, but you don’t have to. You can, if you choose, speak slowly and calmly, maintain a look of serenity on your face, and hold your body in an open, relaxed posture.

Emotions Are Like The Weather Emotions are like the weather—they’re always present and constantly changing. They continually ebb and flow, from mild to intense, pleasant to unpleasant, predictable to utterly unexpected. A ‘mood’ refers to the general tone of emotion across a period of time. A ‘feeling’ refers to a discrete episode of emotion with distinctive, recognisable characteristics. In our weather analogy, a ‘bad mood’ is akin to an overcast day, whereas a feeling of anger or anxiety is akin to a storm. We’re always experiencing emotion of some sort, just as there is always weather of some sort—although sometimes it isn’t strong enough or distinct enough"

It has evolved on the basis that if something is threatening you, your best chance of survival is either to run away (flight) or to stand your ground and defend yourself (fight). You heart rate speeds up, your body floods with adrenaline, blood shunts to the large muscles of your arms and legs and your breathing increases to give you more oxygen, all of which primes you to flee or else stay and fight.

Contrast these terms with ‘expand’: to increase in extent, size, volume, scope; to spread, unfold or develop. Basically, expansion means making room for our feelings. If we give unpleasant feelings enough space, they no longer stretch us or strain us. Typically, when unpleasant emotions arise, we ‘tense up’; that is, our muscles tighten and contract. It’s as if we were trying to squeeze these feelings out, to push them out of our body by sheer brute force. With expansion, we’re intending the very opposite. Instead of squeezing down, we’re opening up. Instead of increasing tension, we’re releasing it. Instead of contracting, we’re expanding. We also commonly talk about being ‘under pressure’.

Most people imagine a vast, open space. This is what we are aiming for in expansion: to open up to our feelings and make plenty of room for them. This will ease the pressure, lighten the tension and free those feelings to move. Sometimes they will move very rapidly; sometimes they will move more slowly. But as long as we make room for them, they will move. And more importantly, expansion frees us to invest our energy in creating a better life, rather than wasting it in useless struggles. ‘Hang on a minute,’ you may say, ‘if I make"

The Two Selves Revisited The process of expansion primarily involves the observing self, not the thinking self, so let’s just take a moment to recap their differences. The thinking self is responsible for thinking, in the broadest sense of the word; it produces all our thoughts, judgements, images, fantasies and memories; and is commonly called ‘the mind’. The observing self is responsible for awareness, attention and focus; it can observe thoughts, images, memories etc., but cannot produce them; and it has no commonly used word to describe it.

Expansion In practising expansion, we need to sidestep the thinking self—to put aside its unhelpful comments—and connect with our emotions through the observing self. This enables us to experience our emotions directly, to see them as they actually are, rather than as the thinking self says they are. According to the thinking self, ‘negative’ emotions are giant, dangerous demons, but the observing self reveals them for what they are: relatively small and harmless. So in practising expansion, the aim is to observe your emotions, not to think about them. There’s just one problem: the thinking self never shuts up! (At least, not for more than a few seconds at a time.) This means that while you practise expansion, your thinking self will continually try to distract you.

It’s also effortless. However, that does not mean it’s easy! Remember the quicksand scenario? Lying back and floating on quicksand is simple and effortless, yet it’s far from easy. Why? Because every instinct in your body tells you to struggle. But don’t worry. If you fell into quicksand several times a week, you’d soon be a pro at lying back and floating.

Look for the one that bothers you the most. For example, it may be a lump in your throat, a knot in your stomach, tightness in your chest or a teary feeling in your eyes. (If your entire body feels uncomfortable, then just pick the area that bothers you the most.) Focus your attention on that sensation.

Begin with a few deep breaths—the slower the better —and make sure you fully empty your lungs before breathing in.

STEP 3: ALLOW ‘Allow’ means you allow the sensation to be there, even though you don’t like it or want it. In other words, you ‘let it be’. When your mind starts commenting on what’s happening, just say, ‘Thanks, Mind!’ and come back to observing. Of course, you may find this difficult. You may feel a strong urge to fight with it or push it away. If so, just acknowledge this urge without giving in to it.

We don’t advocate exposing yourself to discomfort unless it is in the service of something important.

Q: Lots of self-help approaches suggest that when we are feeling bad we should try things like having a hot bath, listening to music, reading a good book, savouring a hot chocolate, getting a massage, walking the dog playing a sport we love, spending time with friends, and so on. Are you suggesting we shouldn’t try such activities? A: This is similar to a question I answered in Chapter 2. I’m sure you’ve had plenty of great advice from all sorts of sources about helpful activities to try when you’re feeling ‘bad’.

Eating disorders come with their own powerful urges, too: to eat, starve or induce vomiting.

First I feel my mouth watering, then my tongue gets fidgety and starts licking my lips. Then a vague tension starts in my jaws, as if they want to chew on something.

The activity doesn’t have to be anything mind-blowing.

In this chapter, we’re going to look at the similarities and differences between ACT and other approaches to human suffering. But first we need to introduce and define a new word: ‘mindfulness’. It’s a slightly confusing word because it has nothing to do with having ‘a full mind’. Different books will give you different definitions of ‘mindfulness’, depending on their content. A spiritual or religious book will define it very differently to a book on sports psychology or effective leadership. So here’s my definition: ‘mindfulness’ means consciously bringing awareness to your here-and- now experience, with openness, receptiveness and interest. This definition tells us several things. Firstly, mindfulness is a conscious process; something we do deliberately. Secondly, it’s not a thinking process; it’s about awareness.

We let our judgements, complaints, and criticisms come and go, and instead we fully engage in the present moment. When we are mindful of our own thoughts, we can see them for what they are, and let them go. When we are mindful of our feelings, we can make room for them and let them be.

ACT Is About Taking Action ACT is based firmly in the tradition of behavioural psychology: a branch of science that seeks to understand, predict and influence human behaviour. A major concept in ACT is the idea of ‘workability’. (It’s a concept I’ve been referring to throughout this book, but I haven’t given it a name until now.) The workability of any given behaviour means how well it works in the long run toward creating a rich and meaningful life. In ACT, we learn mindfulness skills to assist us in taking action to improve our life. We do not practise mindfulness in order to enter some mystical state, or to get in touch with a higher truth. In any given circumstance, if defusion, expansion and connection can help you act effectively, then it makes sense to practise them. Conversely,"

But whereas most religions prescribe a ready-made set of values for you, ACT asks you to clarify and connect with your own values. Moreover, ACT does not encourage you to adopt any particular belief system. (Thus, my frequent advice throughout this book: ‘Don’t believe something just because I say so—trust your own experience.’) ACT takes the view that if your beliefs work to enrich your life, then that’s all that matters.

One particularly unhelpful idea that commonly occurs in books proposing various paths to enlightenment is the utter falsehood that ‘negativity is unnatural’. Evolutionary biology tells us otherwise.

But this alters the levels of the gases in our bloodstream, creating a chemical imbalance in the body. And this imbalance triggers a whole series of physical changes in the body, including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure and increased muscle tension.

I’ll deal with it first thing tomorrow morning.’ Her boss looked astounded. Michelle’s anxiety skyrocketed and her mind started telling her all sorts of horror stories.

Sit or lie comfortably with your eyes closed. For the first six minutes connect with your breathing.

Let any thoughts and feelings come and go, and each time you notice that your attention has wandered, gently refocus. (You’ll need to do this again and again ... and again.)

And let’s face it: thinking skills are really important in solving many problems in life. Indeed, Part 3 of this book places a major emphasis on effective thinking. But there’s more to human consciousness than just the thinking self—we also have the observing self. ‘I think, therefore I am,’ said Descartes. In other words, the mere fact that I have thoughts proves that I exist. But this begs the question: Who is there to observe those thoughts? ‘ I am,’ you may say. But then, who, precisely, is this ‘I’? Feeling a little confused? Good—that’s the perfect state to start from. We’re embarking on another major paradigm shift and strong reactions are expected.

Those who could not connect with a deeper value soon lost the will to live—and thus, their lives. Frankl’s own sense of purpose came from several sources. For example, he deeply valued his loving relationship with his wife and was determined to survive so he could one day see her again. Many a time during strenuous work shifts in the snow, with his feet in agony from frostbite and his body racked with pain from brutal beatings, he would conjure up a mental image of his wife and think about how much he loved her.

On the one hand he valued being a loving father, and he wanted to spend as much time with his young son as possible.

Chapter 28 FINDING FULFILMENT In western society we tend to lead a goal-focused life. Life is all about achievement, and success is usually defined in terms of status, wealth and power. Typically, we aren’t that closely connected with our values and, because of that, we can easily get caught up in goals that are not truly meaningful to us. For instance, we can get so caught up in earning money or furthering our careers that we neglect to spend time with our family—the classic workaholic syndrome. A more destructive version of the goal-focused life is when our goals centre on avoiding painful thoughts and feelings."

This means the goals we pursue are a lot more personally meaningful. And life itself becomes much more rewarding. We live more in the present and we appreciate what we have. So even as we move toward our goals, we find a deep satisfaction in life as it is right now. To make this distinction clearer, consider the following story.

Jeff was a businessman in his mid-thirties, making a reasonable living but obsessed with earning more.

I asked Jeff, ‘What do you really want?’ Jeff: To be absolutely honest, I want to be stinking rich. Russ: Fair enough. If you were stinking rich, what would that enable you to do?

As soon as you start setting goals, Radio Doom and Gloom will start to broadcast, ‘I can’t do it’, ‘It’s too hard’, ‘I’m wasting my time’, ‘There’s no point in trying’ and a whole play list of other golden oldies.

If you see the thought, ‘You’ll fail’ as only words, it’s a lot easier to accept it.

If we buy into this woefully limited definition, then we’re condemned to a goal-focused life: chronic frustration and wanting punctuated by fleeting moments of gratification. So I invite you now to consider a new definition: success in life means living by your values.

One day, after many more failed attempts, one of Edison’s assistants complained, ‘It’s hopeless; we’ll never make a light bulb.’ Edison replied, ‘Nonsense! We now know more about how not to make a light bulb"

The point is, you can appreciate the journey of life, no matter how far you are from your destination. Edison valued the process of scientific discovery and was therefore able to appreciate that each individual experiment furthered his scientific knowledge, regardless of the results. Naturally, it was thrilling when the experiments gave him good results, but he could appreciate the voyage of discovery, even when land was nowhere in sight.

Choose To Grow A core theme in this book is that life involves pain. Sooner or later we all experience it—physically, emotionally and psychologically. But in every painful life circumstance there is an opportunity for us to grow. Earlier in the book we encountered Roxy, a 32-year-old lawyer who had been diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis).

Her relationships with men were typically short-lived and superficial because she never had the time or energy to invest in them. And she rarely found time just to chill out and have fun. After her diagnosis, Roxy realised that her life was out of balance.

Expansion: Making room for feelings, sensations and urges and allowing them to come and go as they please, without fighting them, running from them or giving them undue attention.

The concept of mindfulness has been around in the East for thousands of years-but until recently, we in the West could only develop these skills if we embarked on long, slow, arduous Eastern practices, such as meditation, yoga, Tai-Chi, Zen, or the martial arts. However, thanks to cutting-edge developments in western psychology, you can now learn these powerful life-changing techniques in a matter of minutes.
