The first edition of this book has been read, reread, and recommended to others by therapists, patients, and people seeking to improve their lives. When I first began developing cognitive therapy (CT) in the late 1950s, I had no idea that it would become one of the most effective and widely prac- ticed psychotherapies in the world. Originally, this therapy was designed to help people overcome depression. Our positive results in treating depression were followed by widespread interest in CT. Today CT is the most widely practiced form of psychotherapy in the world, in large part because the treat- ment has been shown to produce positive, often rapid outcomes with enduring effects. CT has been successfully used to help patients with depression, panic dis- order, phobias, anxiety, anger, stress- related disorders, relationship problems, drug"

For any of us, it is much easier to keep trying something when we know we are making progress. For example, when we first learn to read, we often begin by learning the alpha- bet and recognizing individual letters. Initially, we need to put a lot of effort and practice into recognizing letters. As our skill develops, our recognition of letters becomes easier and more automatic. Over time, we stop paying attention to individual letters, because we have learned to put these letters together and learn simple words. As new readers, we may scan a page looking for words we know. Over time, we develop the skill to read simple sentences, and we know we are making progress when we can read more compli- cated sentences, paragraphs,"

One afternoon a therapist received a telephone call from Sylvie, a 73-year- old woman who was concerned about her husband, Ben. She had read an article about depression, and it seemed to describe him. For the past six months, Ben had complained constantly about feeling tired; yet Sylvie heard him pacing around the living room at three in the morning, unable to sleep. In addition, she said he was not as warm as usual toward her, and he was often irritable and negative. He had stopped visiting his friends and didn’t seem interested in doing anything. After his doctor checked him and said he didn’t have a medical problem that would explain these symptoms, Ben complained to his wife, “I hate getting old. It feels lousy.” The therapist asked to talk with Ben"

How we understand our problems has an effect on how we cope. Ben thought that his sleep problems, tiredness, irritability, and lack of interest in doing things were normal parts of growing older. Growing old was something Ben couldn’t change, so he didn’t expect that anything could help him feel better.

One year he scored in a big football game, yet Vic was disap- pointed because a teammate scored twice in the same game. A good performance was not enough for Vic if it was not also the best. As an adult, Vic found it harder and harder to be the best. He juggled the roles of husband, father, and marketing executive, judging his worth by his performance in each of these areas.

Thoughts help determine which mood we experience in a given situation. Once a mood is present, we often begin thinking additional thoughts that support and strengthen the mood. For example, angry people think about ways they have been hurt, depressed people think about all the negative aspects of their lives, and anxious people think about danger. This does not mean that our thinking is wrong when we experience an intense mood. But when we feel intense moods, we are more likely to distort, discount, or dis- regard information that contradicts the validity of our moods and beliefs.

These experiences shaped her beliefs that she was worthless, unac- ceptable, and unlovable, and that men were dangerous, abusive, and uncaring. It is understandable that Marissa’s earliest attempts to make sense of her experiences led her to devalue herself and be on the lookout for the negative reactions of others.

Moods can be difficult to name. You may feel tired all the time and not recognize that you are depressed. Or you may feel nervous and out of con- trol and not recognize that you are anxious. Along with depression and anxiety, anger, shame, and guilt are very common moods that can be troubling (see Chapters 13–15). IDENTIFYING MOODS The list in the box below shows"

While the student tossed and hit the ball over and over again, the coach focused attention on each part of the student’s motion and swing. The coach never criticized the student, but instead gave feedback after each hit about the position of the racquet, the height of the ball toss, the angle of the racquet as it hit the ball, and the student’s motion during the racquet follow- through. In tennis, the ball needs to land in a service square in order to be a successful hit. Yet, remarkably, the"

Skilled laborers instruct their apprentices by showing them how to accomplish indi- vidual tasks on a work project.

Depression For example, when we feel sad or depressed, we tend to be self- critical and have negative thoughts about our lives and futures, as described in Chapter 13. Therefore, if you are experiencing depression or similar moods, like sadness, discouragement, or disappoint- ment, ask yourself, “What does this mean about me?” “What does this mean about my life?” “What does this mean about my future?” These questions help identify the nega- tive automatic thoughts related to those moods. Anxiety Chapter 14 describes how, when we are anxious, we tend to imagine a series of “worst- case” events and outcomes: We overestimate danger and underestimate our ability to cope with things that go wrong. Sometimes anxious thoughts begin with “What if . . . ?” and end with a prediction of something terrible happening. When this occurs, in addition to writing down the “What if . . ."

I see an image of paramedics coming and carrying me away. Everyone is staring, and I’m so embarrassed.” Therefore, when 56 Mind Over Mood you feel anxious, scared, nervous, or similar moods, it is helpful to ask, “What am I afraid might happen? What is the worst that could happen?” When you are asking these questions, it can also be helpful to think about what you imagine your own worst responses might be to the situation (e.g., an image of losing control and running from the room screaming).

Since Judy didn’t really say what she was thinking and feeling when she looked at him, Vic didn’t really know for sure that her look was a “negative one” directed at him.

Ben pondered the questions in the Helpful Hints while he studied the evidence in columns 4 and 5. At first, he struggled to see the situation differently.

For Ben, positive thinking would have ignored real changes that were taking place in his family (his children and grandchildren were getting older).

When we are sad, for example, we think about sad things; Alternative or Balanced Thinking 113 when we are ashamed, we think about all the bad things we have done.

When Jia arrived in Mexico, her taxi driver spoke English, as did the people working in her hotel. After unpacking, she decided to go to the neighborhood pharmacy to buy some postcards and stamps. In the pharmacy, everyone was speaking Spanish rapidly. Jia reviewed her digital translator, and then stepped hesitantly up to the counter and spoke the phrases in Spanish she believed would order stamps and postcards. To Jia’s surprise, the woman behind the counter smiled and handed her the number of cards and stamps she wanted to purchase. Why was Jia surprised?

Even though Jia believed that her Spanish phrases were correct, she did not have confidence in the language until she began to receive positive reactions from the people she met in Mexico. As she spoke Spanish more regularly, she gained greater confidence. Developing new alternative or balanced thoughts may be like writing in a new lan- guage for you.

One of the main reasons Marissa felt so hopeless was that she was convinced she would be fi red from her job and would not be able to support herself and her children. She had a life insurance policy and thought it would provide for her children until they could support themselves. Marissa tested the automatic thought “I will lose my job” on a Thought Record (see Chapters 6–9). Although this thought could not be considered absolutely true until it happened, Marissa had some pretty convincing evidence that losing her job was a real possibility.

In Chapters 6–9, you learned to use a Thought Record to identify and test automatic thoughts – the thoughts that come into your mind automatically in specific situations. In addition to automatic thoughts, we each have beliefs that run quietly beneath the surface. We are often not aware of these thoughts, but they also have a strong influence on our moods, our behavior, and our physical reactions. Because these thoughts usu- ally operate below our awareness, we call them “underlying assumptions.” Underlying assumptions are the rules we live by.

Why did Shauntelle wait so long to get ready, when she knew that this irritated Trey? The underlying assumptions Trey and Shauntelle held can help us make perfect sense of their responses. Trey grew up in a family that valued punctuality and operated under the rule that an invitation for a party or get- together at 7:00 meant that the guests were expected to arrive at 7:00. In Trey’s family, arriving later than 7:00 was a sign of disrespect. There- fore, he held the underlying assumption “If we don’t arrive on time, then it will be dis-"

Simply using Thought Records was not enough, because Linda only fully believed the alternative thoughts when she was not anxious. When we have trouble believing an alternative thought even though the evidence supports it, it is likely that our hot thought is fueled by an underlying assumption.

In Figure 11.1 (on p. 136), Linda wrote these down in the “Pos- sible problems” and “Strategies to overcome these problems” columns. Because Linda had a surprisingly high degree of anxiety on her first plane flight, she made some changes in her coping plan as she planned for her second trip. First, she drank a glass of milk instead of coffee before leaving for the airport. Second, she left a half hour earlier, so that she wouldn’t need to rush and would have plenty of time to calm herself if anxious. These two changes reduced two natural causes"

Once you identify automatic thoughts, you can ask yourself the same or similar questions to help identify core beliefs.

This meant that he wanted to listen more to Judy even when they disagreed, and also express his views assertively without putting her down. Because he tended to be perfectionistic, Vic learned to use rating scales to reduce his perfectionism. For example, his therapist taught Vic to rate his anger at work and at home on an “anger control” scale. The fol- lowing scale shows how Vic rated his anger control in a conversation with Judy.

He stayed on topic and took one three- minute timeout to cool down when his anger started to feel out of control.

As she worked her way through the worksheets in this chapter, she decided she wanted to build three new core beliefs: “My needs are also important,” “Conflict is nor- mal in relationships, because different people often want different things,” and “If I stand up for myself and tolerate my discomfort, I’ll feel better in the long run.” She decided to do one or"

A lot of recent research shows that an attitude of gratitude can lead to greater hap- piness, improvement in a variety of moods, and even improved physical well-being. It is interesting to note that gratitude plays a role in every major religion. It seems that gratitude can be considered a universal human value that cuts across cultures and has been important throughout time. “Gratitude” means thinking about and being thank- ful for experiences or qualities in ourselves, other people, and the world. When we can identify things to be grateful for or things we appreciate, we are more likely to have our positive core beliefs activated and strengthened. Therefore, one thing each of us can do to improve our mood is to develop a regular practice of gratitude."

ExPRESSING GRATITUDE TO OTHERS Most people find genuine benefits in keeping a gratitude journal. Being aware of things in our lives for which we can be grateful is an important step. Sometimes it can have added value if we express our gratitude to others. There are several potential advantages to expressing our gratitude to other people. First, it gives us more time to focus on grati- tude, because it extends the moment of gratitude. Second, when we talk about the things we feel grateful about to others, they may tell us about things that make them grateful. This can lead to more positive conversations, which can help lift our mood. Third, tell- ing people directly that we are grateful to them for something they have"

There are two different kinds of gratitude you might express to others. First, you can comment (even to strangers) about things you appreciate in the world and your life (Worksheet 12.10).

In one study, people who performed kind acts toward others every day for four weeks felt happier and more satisfied with their relationships. The types of kind acts that led to these changes included small things like opening the door for someone, buying lunch for a friend, smiling at a stranger, letting someone go ahead in a line, visiting an ill friend, giving a compliment, and helping a neighbor with shopping or home repairs.

In the 1960s, Beck demonstrated that depression was characterized by thought patterns that actually maintained depressed mood. For example, Beck noted that when we are depressed, we have negative thoughts about ourselves (self- criticism), our experiences (general nega- tivity), and our future (hopelessness). The following sections describe these three aspects of depressed thinking in detail. Negative Thoughts about Myself Before Marissa began CBT, she was extremely self- critical. For example, she thought, “These awful things happened to me because I’m bad,” “I’m an awful mother and a ter- rible person,” and “It’s my own fault that I was beaten by my husbands.” The themes underlying these thoughts were “I’m worthless,” “I’m unlovable,” and “I’m no good.” Almost everyone who is depressed has self- critical thoughts.

Self/future TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION The good news is that depression can almost always be helped. Most of the strategies taught in this book were originally developed to help people overcome depression. This section summarizes the treatment approaches that have been shown to be most effec- tive: cognitive therapy, medication, improving relationships, and behavioral activation. Research suggests that behavioral activation and cognitive therapy are two of the most effective methods for helping people get better and stay better. Together, these two Understanding Your depression 199 approaches are often referred to as CBT. Although we describe cognitive and behavioral approaches separately,"

Because they are so effective, we emphasize these two approaches in this chapter and the other chapters of this book. People who take medication alone are at greater risk for future relapse than people who combine medication with cognitive and behavioral interventions. If you have been prescribed medication for your depression, learning Mind Over Mood skills can help you minimize the likelihood that you will get depressed again once you get better and stop taking your medication. The following sections describe each type of intervention for depression. If you are depressed, it is often best to start with behavioral activation. We want you to read an overview of all these methods first. We describe behavioral activation last,"

Cognitive Therapy When we are depressed, we tend to notice and remember the negative aspects of our experiences more readily than we do the positive or neutral aspects. We also are more likely to interpret events in our lives with a negative bias when we are depressed. When we are not depressed, we tend to interpret events with a positive bias. For example, sup- pose you invite three people to join you for lunch, and two agree to come. If you are depressed, you will tend to focus on the one person who didn’t come and maybe even conclude, “No one likes me.” If you are not depressed, you are more likely to think, “Most people like me.

As you might imagine, this book is called Mind Over Mood because many of the chapters show you how to make changes in your thinking that will help you feel better. Medication Although medication can sometimes help depression, not everyone who is depressed will benefit from it.

Currently there are dozens of antidepressants available, so you and your physician can’t know with certainty if an antidepressant will work for you until you’ve taken one for a few weeks. Different antidepressant medications may be prescribed, depending on the particular symptoms you have and the specific effect you and your physician want to achieve. If the first anti- depressant prescribed for you does not produce a beneficial effect, then your physician will try others to see if the desired effect can be obtained. Unlike many other medica- tions, antidepressants often take two to four weeks to reach their beneficial effect. And because you may not respond positively to the initial medication prescribed for you, it may take eight weeks or longer"

Being depressed does not mean you are crazy. If you have been stuck in depression for a long time, or if your depression is quite severe, it makes sense to try to find things that will help you feel better.

You and your physician can evaluate together how long you should take medication. In any case, when your physician recommends that you decrease antidepres- sant medication, she or he will want you to decrease them gradually and systematically. It is important for you to follow your physician’s directions in taking and stopping anti- depressant medications.

Often we don’t feel motivated to do things until we actu- ally get started. You may be surprised to learn that motivation often follows doing something rather than coming first, especially when we are depressed. If you have skipped one or more activities on your schedule, try not to get discouraged or to criticize yourself. Just pick up where you are and do the next activity on your schedule.

While these purposes sound like good things, safety behaviors actually often make our anxiety worse, because they increase our perception that this situation is much more dangerous that it may actually be. Here are some examples. Tyra is afraid of snakes. When she takes her daughter to the zoo, she checks on the Understanding Your Anxiety 227 map to see where the snake exhibit is housed. Even though she would prefer avoiding this exhibit, her daughter wants to see the snakes, so she goes into the exhibit.

This is because safety behaviors prevent us from fully facing our fears and having the opportunity to build our confidence that we can handle things that go wrong or seem dangerous to us. Good coping, on the other hand, usually involves approaching our fears and man- aging our reactions and the situations that scare us.

When we are anx- ious, we have thoughts about danger, threat, and our own vulnerability. A threat or danger can be physical, mental, or social. A physical threat occurs when you believe you will be physically hurt (e.g., a snake bite, a heart attack, being hit). A social threat occurs when you believe you will be rejected, humiliated, embarrassed, or bullied. A mental threat occurs when something makes you worry that you are going crazy or losing your mind.

Mindfulness and Acceptance “Mindfulness” is a practice of learning to stay in the present moment and observe with full attention your experience and immediate surroundings. Part of mindfulness is also accepting your experiences without making judgments about them. For example, you may often walk down a street with your mind focused on what happened earlier in the day or what will happen later, or you may even be scanning texts or emails on a mobile device.

Her initial thoughts were “I won’t be able to handle this. I’ll have a panic attack,” and she became anxious. Linda then decided to experiment with mindfulness.

Understanding Your Anxiety 243 Breathing A related way to manage your anxiety is to practice balanced, deep breathing. Many people breathe shallowly or irregularly when they are anxious or tense. These breath- ing patterns lead to an imbalance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body, which can cause the physical symptoms of anxiety. For example, when we breathe more shallowly, we take in less oxygen. One of the functions of the heart is to pump oxygen throughout the body via the blood stream. If the heart gets less oxygen, it beats faster to try to supply the same amount of oxygen to the body. In the beginning, it is important to practice balanced, deep"

Progressive Muscle Relaxation “Progressive muscle relaxation” is a technique in which the major muscle groups in the body are alternately tensed and relaxed.

Understanding Your Anxiety 251 Chapter 14 Summary X Common types of anxiety include phobias, social anxiety, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, health worries, and generalized anxiety disorder. X Anxiety symptoms include a wide range of physical reactions; moods that range from nervousness to panic; avoidance of situations or feelings; and worries about danger, as well as thoughts about not being able to cope. X Common behaviors when we are anxious are avoidance and safety behaviors. These types of behaviors reduce our anxiety in the short term, but make our anxiety worse over time. X Anxious thoughts include overestimations of danger, along with underestimations of our ability to cope with the threats we anticipate. X Thoughts that accompany anxiety often begin with “What if . . . ?” and contain the theme that “Something terrible is going to happen, and I won’t be able to cope.” X Our anxious thoughts"

In this way, assertion can reduce the fre- quency of being treated unfairly or being taken advantage of, and therefore can prevent situations that give rise to anger. It also gives you a greater sense of control in your life. Four Strategies to Help You Plan and Practice Assertive Responses 1. Use “I” statements. Angry statements tend to begin with the word “you” and express blame for problems (e.g., “You always think of yourself first”). Starting a con- versation in this way often puts the other person on the defensive, and the person is then less likely to hear what you have to say. Assertive responses often"

Expressing a need or request is more likely to lead the other person to hear your message, and is thus more likely to lead to a productive conversation. 2. Acknowledge any truth in someone’s complaints about you, and at the same time stand up for your own rights. For example, imagine that someone asks you to do something, and you say no. The other person then says, “But I really need you to do this for me, and it seems selfish for you not to help out if you can.” You might reply, “I understand you are disappointed, and yet I need to say no, because I am really tired right now. That is not being selfish; it is just taking care of myself.” 3. Make"

Forgiving Others When someone has deeply or repeatedly hurt us, anger can last a long time. Ongoing anger can eat away at our spirit and prevent us from experiencing happiness and joy. In this case, finding a way to let go of anger may be worthwhile. Forgiving others who have hurt us can help us let go of anger and hurt.

We feel guilty when we judge that we have done something wrong. If we think we “should” have behaved differently or that we “ought” to have done better, we are likely to feel guilt. Shame also involves the sense that we have done something wrong.

Breaking the Silence Surrounding Shame When secretiveness surrounds shame, it may be important to talk to a trusted person about what occurred. The need to keep silent is often based on the expectation that revealing your secret will result in condemnation, criticism, or rejection. It is not unusual for people who have carried a secret for a lifetime to be surprised at the acceptance they receive when they reveal their secret. Acceptance runs counter to the anticipated rejec- tion and forces a reassessment of the meaning of your secret. Although you may not trust anyone fully,"

When you actively imagine new behaviors, you are more likely to carry them out. You can use positive imagery to help create positive change in your life. When you want to make positive changes, you can use Action Plans (Chapter 10) or behavioral experiments (Chapter 11) to try out new ways of doing things and see what works best for you.

One of our recom- mended activities to reduce depression is to notice and enjoy small positive experiences (Chapter 13). Savoring positive experiences when you are not depressed can help cre- ate greater life satisfaction. You also learned that it is important to engage in a variety of activities when you are depressed (activities that are pleasurable, give you a sense of accomplishment, help in overcoming avoidance, and fit with your values). When you are feeling better, these same types of activities can help you create a life filled with sat- isfaction and well-being.

Ben conquered his depression by testing his thoughts on Thought Records and by doing experiments to learn new ways of interacting with his children and grandchildren. He also found completing Activity Schedules and keeping a gratitude journal very helpful. By the end of therapy, he felt much happier. He resumed meeting with his friends, tink- ering with projects in his garage, and doing a variety of activities with his wife, Sylvie.

You’ve been a terrific help, and you know I didn’t believe therapy could help.” Ben’s therapist smiled and told Ben, “Well, you deserve the credit. You worked very hard to feel better.” Ben had worked hard in therapy. Almost every day he made some attempt to feel better. Some days he identified his moods and thoughts; other days he increased his activities or experimented with new behaviors.

During particularly difficult times (e.g., when she was getting critical feedback at work, when she and her therapist were discussing her childhood abuse, when Marissa became discouraged and stopped doing Thought Records), her depression scores were higher (she was more depressed). As Marissa improved her ability to use problem solving, Thought Records, and experi- ments, her depression scores were lower (she was less depressed).
