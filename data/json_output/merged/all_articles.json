The current standard VR systems use VR headsets with head-mounted display. VR provides not only visual and auditory stimuli but also tactile and olfactory stimuli. The subjective feeling that a user experiences in VR as “being there” is termed presence. By presenting VR worlds in therapy, the patients’ typical experiences in real life are evoked to improve their behavior and overcome their problems.Patients can enter anxious situations or diffi- cult social situations in VR in which situations can be graded in difficulty and repeatedly rehearsed in the presence of a therapist before the patients try out these new therapeutic strategies in real life.

This review discusses the available evidence on clinical applications of VR therapies for a number of psychiatric disorders, i.e., anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), substance use disorders (SUDs), eating disorders, psychotic disorders, and the neurodevelopmental disorders autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). VR is used for not only treatment but also assessment purposes. VR enables researchers to design scenarios that can be used to assess real-time behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and phys- iological responses to a virtual environment.

Assessment in Social Anxiety Disorder Research has investigated whether VR can be used to reliably and validly assess social anxiety and public speaking anxiety, but results are inconclusive. Until recently, the technology was limited so that the preprogrammed avatars used in conversation could not be controlled to interact and converse with the patient in real time. Powers et al. (2013) investigated a new technology allow- ing the operator to directly control the avatar’s behavior and speaking during VR conversations. Results showed that VR conversation successfully enhanced fear (d = 2.29). Actually, participants rated their fear higher during VR conversation than during in vivo conversation. Kampmann et al.

The in vivo BAT did not prove to be a significant predictor of everyday social anxiety. Other studies have investigated physiological differences between subjects undergoing a VR BAT and those undergoing an in vivo BAT. Generally, a VR BAT (e.g., giving a speech to a virtual audience) and an in vivo BAT resulted in comparable changes in salivary cortisol levels, cardiovascular ac- tivity, electrodermal activity, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and eye movements (fixation duration of faces) (see Emmelkamp et al. 2020)."

Assessment in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Given that some soldiers may overreport PTSD symptoms to get benefits or may underreport PTSD symptoms because of shame, it has been suggested that VR can be used for assessment of PTSD in active duty soldiers and veterans. A few studies have investigated whether psychophys- iological responses when soldiers and veterans are confronted with realistic VR worlds would be more informative than self-reported symptoms, but results so far are inconclusive (see Myers et al. 2016, Rizzo & Shilling 2017). To investigate mechanisms underlying the development of trauma symptoms, VR worlds have been investigated as an analog to real trauma. Up to now, the trauma film paradigm has been used as an analog for posttraumatic stress. Such analog trauma VR worlds proved to be as ef- fective in inducing intrusive memories in a normal population as traumatic film (Cuperus et al. 2017, Dibbets & Schulte-Osterman"

In another study, the same group (Kim et al. 2012) used the virtual environment as a diagnostic tool to discriminate patients with checking behavior from those without. These researchers developed a virtual environment with a house and office for the assessment of anxiety and compulsions in patients with OCD. A high level of anxiety was found in patients with OCD with checking behavior relative to OCD patients without checking behavior and healthy controls. Patients with checking behavior showed a higher checking frequency and spent more time on checking and more time on gazing during checking behavior. This finding is in line with more experimental research (van den Hout et al. 2019), in which individuals with obsessive checking be- havior experience greater uncertainty in uncertain situations, which in turn leads them to engage in checking behavior: Feelings of uncertainty provoke checking behavior, and checking behavior preserves feelings of uncertainty."

However, in contrast to the studies by Kim and colleagues (2010, 2012), here it concerned a vir- tual game environment: No 3D goggles to immerse the patient in a 3D perspective were used.

Moreover, in alcohol-abusing patients and in cocaine- and cannabis-using patients, VR has proven to be effective in inducing craving (see Segawa et al. 2020). Regarding alcohol abuse, social pressure by virtual avatars led to greater craving than did virtual alcohol cues (Ghi¸t˘a & Gutiérrez Maldonado 2018).

The dominant theory in explaining the effects of exposure therapy was previously the emotional processing theory (Foa & Kozak 1986), but in recent years the inhibitory learning the- ory has become the preferred theory to explain the powerful effects of exposure (Craske et al. 2014). For an extensive overview of the efficacy of exposure therapy in specific phobias, see a re- view about different aspects concerning the success of exposure therapy (Böhnlein et al. 2020).

Addiction Addictive behaviors are viewed as learned habits that are reinforced by rewards according to op- erant learning principles. Addictive substances stimulate the pleasure centers in the brain, thus providing positive reinforcement for substance abuse. In many cases, however, substance abuse is also negatively reinforced by amelioration of negative feelings. Many addiction theories assume that craving plays a central role in the acquisition and maintenance of substance dependence (see Emmelkamp & Vedel 2006). In some CBT protocols, patients are treated with cue exposure, con- sisting of repeated exposure to the sights or smells of"

Eating Disorders VR is used primarily in a therapeutic context to investigate two main aspects of eating disorders: body image distortions (relevant for anorexia and bulimia nervosa) and uncontrolled eating (binge eating and bulimia). To assess body image distortions, 3D figures of the patient’s body are created and presented to the patient, thus enabling the patient to become aware of the body image dis- tortion and to get a more realistic view of the body. To address uncontrolled eating, cue exposure to eating-related stimuli is used. VR environments simulate real-life situations and food cues that trigger disordered eating behavior. Clus et al.

The third canonical correlation depicted reduced procrastination and reduced concern for social desirability as associated with a pattern of poorer mental health and increased mental health help-seeking behaviours.

Furthermore, an international consortium (Bijl et al., 2003) examined the prevalence rates of treated and untreated mental disorders in ﬁve countries: Canada, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. The largest discrepancies were found for Canada (19.9% of people diagnosed with a DSM-IV disor- der and only 7% seeking treatment in the past year), the United States (29.1% and 10.9%) and the Netherlands (24.4% and 13.4%). Research on procrastination and physical health (Sirois, 2007; Sirois, Melia-Gordon, & Pychyl, 2003) suggests an investigation of procrastination as both a possible contributor to ailment and a behavioural barrier to treatment in the mental health domain. 1.1.

Trait pro- crastination is the predisposition to postpone that which is necessary to reach some goal (Lay, 1986). The current study exam- ines trait procrastination on academic and everyday tasks as it re- lates to mental health and help-seeking. Procrastination has been linked to many negative mental health states. Anxiety and depres- sion are positively correlated with self-report and behavioural measures of procrastination (Beswick, Rothblum, & Mann, 1988; Martin, Flett, Hewitt, Krames, & Szanto, 1996). Stress and mental health have been repeatedly found to vary in- versely (e.g., DeLongis, Lazarus, & Folkman, 1988) and with likely reciprocal inﬂuence (Hammen, 2005).

In a student sample, all participants re- ported experiencing stress resulting from procrastination (Schraw, Wadkins, & Olafson, 2007). Procrastinating online was also linked to perceived stress relief (Lavoie & Pychyl, 2001). The relation be- tween procrastination and stress may vary depending on the urgency of the stressor. Tice and Baumeister (1997) found that stu- dents who procrastinated at the beginning of a semester experi- enced less stress and fewer illness symptoms. However, at the end of a semester, with deadlines and examinations looming, procrasti- nators tended to have greater stress, more illness symptoms, more 0191-8869/$ - see front matter \u0002 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Procrastination, stress and treatment delay Individual differences in personality are related to help-seeking for emotional problems (Rickwood & Braithwaite, 1994). More spe- ciﬁcally, procrastination acts as a barrier to help-seeking for drug abuse (McCoy, Metsch, Chitwood, & Miles, 2001) and gambling (Bellringer, Pulford, Abbott, DeSouza, & Clarke, 2008). Procrastina- tion may thus be a barrier to help-seeking for other mental health concerns. The present study extends into the mental health domain pre- vious research (Sirois, 2007; Sirois et al., 2003) examining the relation between procrastination, stress, physical illness and the practice of wellness behaviours (i.e. seeing a physician or ensur- ing proper nutrition).

Procrastinators experienced poorer health, treat- ment delay, stress, and fewer wellness behaviours. Stress was found to fully mediate the procrastination-illness relationship. Analyses in a subsequent replication generalized original ﬁndings to a community-dwelling adult sample (Sirois, 2007). Consistent with the previous ﬁndings, procrastination was associated with higher stress, more acute health problems, and the practice of fewer wellness behaviours. Procrastinators also reported less frequent household safety behaviours and dental and medical check-ups. In this study (Sirois, 2007), stress fully mediated the procrastination-health relationship. Initially, health behaviours also appeared to mediate the procrastination-health relationship. However, after considering the covariance with stress, health behaviours proved not to be a signiﬁcant mediator (Sirois, 2007).

We predicted that the combination of pro- crastination tendencies and stress levels would affect mental health and help-seeking conjunctively.

A control analysis on a dichotomized MHB scale did not substantially impact results. Large sample size reduces the undesirable impact of kurtosis and skew and canonical correlation analysis tends to be robust to vio- lations of parametric assumptions (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). Consequently, the MHB scale’s original format was retained. 3.2.

Although the strong connection between stress and poorer mental health is by no means a new ﬁnding, the problematic impediment of trait pro- crastination can now be veriﬁably incorporated within this picture. Our ﬁndings suggest that procrastinators, younger people, males, and those inﬂuenced by social desirability concerns are more likely to be impeded from seeking help with mental health concerns.

Exercise can be used as a recreational activity as a means to reintroduce individuals into the wider community. This is often an important element of treatment plans for people who have less severe mental health problems. Exercise has the potential to reach a broad audience who might not be able to access other types of psychological interventions or prefer not to use drug- based treatments.

Exercise therapy, unlike drugs, requires individuals to become involved in an active rather than a passive rehabilitation process. In other words, drug interventions do no require any physical effort, are externally regulated and participants are passive recipients in the process. In contrast to this, exercise is more internally based and requires participants to experience physical commitment and effort.

This suggests that the primary stimulus for promoting affective change is the elevation in body temperature from exercise, and this alteration in physiological state is manifested in a number of responses that are orchestrated by the hypo- thalamus.

Support for the hyperthermic explanation has been mixed and, in fact, there are many studies that have failed to demonstrate a positive relationship between exercise, increases in temperature and improved psychological states. It is now thought that there are more comprehensive models that explain the relationship between physical activity and psychological well-being more accurately.

Christie & Chesher (1982) have also demonstrated that mice can become ‘swimming junkies’ if they exercise regularly. Unfortunately, because of the inherent problems of examining β-endorphin receptor site occupancy in humans, research has attempted to examine peripheral β-endorphin levels (blood outside the blood–brain barrier) after exercise (see Synder, 1977). Furthermore, DeMeirlier et al (1986) reported a positive relationship between https://doi.org/10.1192/apt.8.4.262 Published online by Cambridge University Press APT (2002), vol. 8, p. 266 Daley β-endorphins and exercise, which they contended leads to more positive affective states.

Self-esteem and mastery explanations There are a number of theoretical models that have attempted to consider the possible relationship between participation in physical activity and self- esteem. One such model is Sonstroem’s (1978) psychological model for physical activity. This model assumes that involvement in physical activity increases physical ability, which positively influences one’s self-estimation and consequently leads to higher levels of self-esteem. Specifically, as individuals with high self-esteem take pride in their bodies, they continue to exercise, thereby maintaining and/or increasing fitness.

This in turn might be effective in changing body perceptions. Related to this, the positive relationship between exercise and mental health could be explained in terms of the physical signs associated with exercise (e.g. muscle tone and weight loss) and these physical signs could be viewed as positive cues towards a sense of achieve- ment in one’s physical self.

Many clinical patients will previously have been mostly sedentary or they will not possess the psychological skills or knowledge to adhere to a regular exercise programme and therefore they will need more than exercise alone. Ideally, exercise should be offered in conjunction with exercise counselling that is aimed at equipping individuals with skills, knowledge and confidence so they feel able to participate in physical exercise on a regular basis throughout the rest of their lives. Therefore, it is important that exercise therapy incorporates practical strategies that give patients the physical and psychological tools to sustain their exercise behaviour and experience positive psychological gains from exercise once the therapy comes to an end.

Moreover, exercise has the potential to influence patients’ physical and psychological health simultaneously and this could have cost implications for the NHS. Faulkner & Biddle (2001) have commented that, regardless of any mental health benefits, exercise should be promoted, since the physical needs of psychiatric clients are often underserved. A number of studies have highlighted that clinical populations tend to suffer from poor physical health. For example, Chamove (1986) has indicated that patients with schizophrenia score well below the normal population on physical fitness. People with schizophrenia are commonly overweight, have excess body fat and are unfit. The physical health of substance misusers could benefit from exercise therapy.

Indeed, it would be unwise for exercise therapists to believe that they can operate without this support. Some guidelines concerning the delivery of exercise therapy are presented in Box 2. Many mental health professionals do not appear to view exercise as a worthwhile strategy. McEntee & Halgin (1996) reported that, even though many psychotherapists believe in the therapeutic value of exercise, only approximately 10% recommended exercise to their clients.

Conclusions Given the prevalence and considerable financial costs associated with poor mental health, exercise as a therapeutic possibility deserves attention. Few clinical psychologists and psychiatrists currently consider exercise therapy as a worthwhile inter- vention strategy that could be useful in reducing mental illness. Whether exercise can be offered to patients as a stand-alone therapy remains to be seen, but the existing evidence suggests that this might be worthwhile adjunctive treatment. Of course, the physiological implications of exercise should not be ignored or underestimated either. Perhaps an important step forward would be the inclusion of information about the exercise and mental health relationship in the training of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who are key stakeholders in the therapeutic process, and who are often involved in the"

Rather, it is hoped that this review will encourage psychologists and psychiatrists to be more open to less conventional alternatives so that patients are offered a range of interventions that might include exercise therapy. It is hoped that exercise therapy will become a mechanism by which the body and mind are viewed as dependent, rather than as separate entities, and that over time mental health professionals will begin to accept more readily the benefits of exercise as a therapy.

TLCs can be used alone or adjunctively and are often accessible and affordable; many can be introduced quickly, some- times even in the ﬁrst session (McMorris, Tomporowski & Audiffren, 2009). TLCs have few negatives. Unlike both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, they are free of stigma and can even confer social beneﬁts and social esteem (Borgonovi, 2009). In addition, they have fewer side effects and complications than medications (Amminger et al., 2010). TLCs offer signiﬁcant secondary beneﬁts to patients, such as improvements in physical health, self-esteem, and quality of life (Deslandes et al., 2009). Furthermore, some TLCs—for example, exercise, diet, and meditation—may also be neuroprotective and reduce the risk of subsequent age-related cognitive losses and corresponding neural shrinkage (Hamer & Chida, 2009; Pagnoni & Cekic, 2007; Raji"

Many TLCs not only reduce psychopathology but can also enhance health and well-being. For example, medita- tion can be therapeutic for multiple psychological and psychosomatic disorders (Chiesa, 2009; Didonna, 2009; Shapiro & Carlson, 2009). Yet it can also enhance psycho- logical well-being and maturity in normal populations and can be used to cultivate qualities that are of particular value to clinicians, such as calmness, empathy, and self-actual- ization (Shapiro & Carlson, 2009; Walsh, 2011; Walsh & Shapiro, 2006). Knowledge of TLCs can beneﬁt clinicians in several ways. Utilizing TLCs may result in greater clinical ﬂexi- bility and effectiveness and less role strain.

For societies, TLCs may offer signiﬁcant community and economic advantages. Economic beneﬁts can accrue from reducing the costs of lifestyle-related disorders such as obesity, which alone accounts for over $100 billion in costs in the United States each year (World Health Orga- nization, 2008). Community beneﬁts can occur both di- rectly through enhanced personal relationships and service (Post, 2007) and indirectly through social networks.

Con- siderable research and clinical evidence support the follow- ing eight TLCs: exercise, nutrition and diet, time in nature, relationships, recreation, relaxation and stress manage- ment, religious and spiritual involvement, and contribution and service to others.

Fourth, executive functions, such as coordination and planning, appear to beneﬁt most, a welcome ﬁnding given that executive func- tions are so important, and that both they and the brain areas that underlie them are particularly age sensitive (Col- combe & Kramer, 2003; Erickson & Kramer, 2009). Finally, meta-analyses reveal the speciﬁc elements of exercise that beneﬁt cognition. Relatively short programs of one to three months in length offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts, though programs of six months or longer are more beneﬁ- cial.

Fortunately, even brief counseling can motivate many patients to exercise (Long et al., 1996), and the risks are minimal, although an initial medical exam may be war- ranted.

Supplements Growing evidence suggests that food supplements offer valuable prophylactic and therapeutic beneﬁts for mental health. Research is particularly being directed to Vitamin D, folic acid, SAME (S-adenosyl-methionine), and—most of all—ﬁsh oil (Sarris, Schoendorfer, & Kavanagh, 2009). Fish and ﬁsh oil are especially important for mental health. They supply essential omega-3 fatty acids, espe- cially EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosa- hexaenoic acid), which are essential to neural function. Systemically, omega-3s are anti-inﬂammatory, counteract the pro-inﬂamatory effects of omega-6 fatty acids, and are protective of multiple body systems. Unfortunately, mod- ern diets are often high in omega-6s and deﬁcient in omega-3s (Freeman et al., 2006). Is this dietary deﬁciency associated with psychopa- thology?

However, epidemiological studies of dementia and omega-3 fatty acid intake are as yet inconclusive (Freeman et al., 2006). Epidemiological, cross-sectional, and clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may be therapeutic for several disorders. Again, depression has been the disorder most closely studied (Stahl, Begg, Weis- inger, & Sinclair, 2008).

This is the biophilia hypothesis, and multiple new ﬁelds—such as diverse schools of ecology, as well as evolutionary, environmental, and eco- psychologies—argue for an inti- mate and inescapable link between mental health and the natural environment (Esbjorn-Hargens & Zimmerman, 2009). In existential terms, the concern is that “modern man—by cutting himself off from nature has cut himself off from the roots"

Clinicians harbor multiple concerns. Evolutionary and developmental perspectives suggest that children in envi- ronments far different from the natural settings in which we evolved, and to which we adapted, may suffer developmen- tal disorders, with ADHD being one possible example (Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002). Likewise, evolutionary theory and cross-cultural research suggest that for adults, artiﬁcial environments and lifestyles may impair mental well-being and also foster or exacerbate psychopathologies such as depression (Buss, 2000). Therapeutic Benefits of Nature Fortunately, natural settings can enhance both physical and mental health. In normal populations, these enhancements include greater cognitive, attentional, emotional, spiritual, and subjective well-being (Ho, Payne, Orsega-Smith, & Godby, 2003; Pryor, Townsend, Maller, & Field, 2006).

Unfortunately, urban noise can exact signiﬁcant cognitive, emotional, and psychosomatic tolls. These range, for example, from mere annoyance to attentional difﬁculties, sleep disturbances, and cardiovas- cular disease in adults and impaired language acquisition in children (Clark & Stansfeld, 2007). By contrast, natural settings offer silence as well as natural sounds and stimuli that attention restoration theory and research suggest are restorative (Berman et al., 2008).

For example, considerable evidence suggests that, compared with Americans in previous de- cades, Americans today are spending less time with family and friends, have fewer intimate friends and conﬁdants, and are less socially involved in civic groups and communities (McPherson, Smith-Lovin & Brashears, 2006; Putnam, 1995, 2000).

For example, the views of one level are taken as normative, and those at this level tend to assume that people at other levels are mistaken, misguided, malev- olent, or disturbed (Wilber, 2005). Many contemporary religious and cultural conﬂicts appear to reﬂect these kinds of cross-level misunderstandings (Walsh, 2009).

Wisely perceived, altruism is not self-sacriﬁce but rather enlight- ened self-interest (Walsh, 1999). As the Dalai Lama put it, “If you’re going to be selﬁsh,"

These beneﬁts of altruism hold major implications for our understanding of health, lifestyle, and therapy. On the basis of their research ﬁndings, Brown, Nesse, Vinokur, and Smith (2003) wrote an article titled “Providing Social Support May Be More Beneﬁcial Than Receiving It” and concluded that interventions “designed to help people feel supported may need to be redesigned so that the emphasis is on what people do to help others” (p. 326). Other researchers quipped, “If giving weren’t free, pharmaceuti- cal companies could herald the discoveries of a stupendous new drug called ‘Give Back’—instead of ‘Prozac’” (Post & Niemark, 2007, p. 7).

Discussion A culture’s technology has far-reaching effects on people’s psychology and lifestyles (Wilber, 2000), and modern tech- nology is now affecting our psychology, biology, society, and lifestyles in ways we are only beginning to compre- hend. Moreover, technological innovations and their life- style effects are changing “more quickly than we know how to change ourselves” (Putnam, 2000, p. 402). Many of the resultant costs are doubtless as yet unrecognized, and this raises a disconcerting question: Could some of our patients be “canaries in the coal mine,” warning us of ways of life that may exact a toll on us all? This is a question that health professionals will need to confront increasingly as technological, environmental, and lifestyle changes accel- erate. Interactions Among Therapeutic Lifestyle Factors Fortunately, individual TLCs appear to counter many med- ical and psychological complications of contemporary pathogenic lifestyles."

For example, physical activity increases neuronogenesis in the rat hippocampus. However, the ef- fect is maximal only when the animals are exposed to a rich social environment rather than living in isolation (Strana- han, Khalil, & Gould, 2006). Similarly, in his program to reverse coronary arteriosclerosis, Dean Ornish employed four TLCs—exercise, vegetarian diet, relaxation and stress management, and social support. Each proved beneﬁcial, and the effects were additive (Pischke et al., 2008). Might this also be true for psychological disorders? Quite possi- bly, but as yet we have no clear answer. Difficulties of Implementing Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Given the many advantages of TLCs, why have mental health professionals been so slow to adopt them? The reasons involve patients, therapists, and society. Effective public health programs"

Patients often have little social support, little understanding of causal lifestyle factors, and a passive expectation that healing comes from an outside authority or a pill (Duncan et al., 2009). Societally, whole industries are geared toward encouraging unhealthy choices. Patients contend with a daily barrage of psychologically sophisti- cated advertisements encouraging them, for example, to consume alcohol, nicotine, and fast food in the never- ending search for what the food industry calls the “bliss point” of “eatertainment” through “hypereating” (Kessler, 588 October 2011 ●American Psychologist This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

The ﬁrst is simply to become familiar with the large literature on TLCs. The second is a professional bias toward pharmacological and formal psychotherapeutic interventions. In addition, foster- ing patients’ TLCs can be time intensive, can demand considerable therapeutic skill, and is not well reimbursed. Therapists may also harbor negative expectations (not without some justiﬁcation) that patients will not maintain the necessary changes. However, it is crucial to be aware of the Rosenthal effect: the self-fulﬁlling power of interper- sonal expectations. Finally, cognitive dissonance may be at work when therapists’ own lifestyles are unhealthy (McEn- tee & Halgin, 1996). Taken together, these therapist beliefs and biases may constitute a variant of what is called professional deforma- tion. This is a harmful distortion"

As long ago as 1915, a sociologist observed that “the continued performance of a certain profession or trade creates in the individual a de- formation of the reasoning process. . . . such deformation is largely a matter of adaptation to environment” (Langerock, 1915). Professional deformation can be extreme. Consider, for example, the forced psychiatric hospitalization and drugging of Soviet dissidents by Soviet mental health pro- fessionals who believed that the counterconventional be- liefs of these “patients” were diagnostic of “sluggish schizophrenia” (van Voren, 2002). However, more subtle forms of professional deforma- tion may be more pervasive and more difﬁcult to recognize. The mental health system’s current pharmacological em- phasis—at the cost of psychotherapeutic, social, and TLC interventions—may be one example. This pharmacological bias is heavily promoted by the pharmaceutical industry, and Marcia"

An obvious question then becomes: Does the widespread underemphasis on lifestyle factors across mental health professions constitute a further example of professional deformation? Are there additional therapeutic lifestyle factors? Cer- tainly, and examples range from sleep hygiene to ethics, community engagement, and the moderating of television viewing, all of which have demonstrated mental health beneﬁts (Ito et al., 2008; Preiss et al., 2006; Putnam, 2000; Walsh, 1999).

In the case of young people diagnosed with psychotic illness - the focus of this paper – technology design should address their special needs for long-term support, ongoing recovery and social connectedness. This paper discusses a project to design, build and trial an online therapy for young people recovering from a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in terms of specific theoretical models. The project aims to produce a user-driven platform which responds to the specific needs of the target population. We have proposed the MOST (Moderated Online Social Therapy) model, combining moderated social networking and therapy components into a novel, fully-integrated system. These components reinforce each other, creating a dynamic environment that promotes ongoing participation and engagement. We locate our work within the field of Positive Computing [3], aimed at advancing human wellbeing.

To inform the design we used research tools from both HCI and the social sciences to develop a rich description of the target group. In prior work we discussed some aspects of our results for a psychiatric audience [4] in terms of usage data and reduction in psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we discuss the user experience 2 of our therapy. We apply theories from HCI to understand how people interact with therapy, focusing in particular on how the principles of Supportive Accountability can be implemented to encourage user engagement in online therapy. We conclude with reflections on the adequacy of our system, and discuss implications for how the high rates of attrition currently experienced in the use of"

This is motivated by a number of factors: • Mental illnesses have a devastating effect on many people [6] . • Young adults in particular are susceptible to mental illness and are thereby at risk of severe disruption during a critical period of social and intellectual development [7]. • Young adults are enthusiastic users of Internet technologies and social networking [8, 9] and might more easily be reached via an online treatment. • Mental illness carries a significant stigma, so that young people do not want to be identified as mental health clients [10]. • There is a need to supplement existing ‘face-to-face’ therapies, which are time-consuming, expensive and require leave from school or work to travel to a clinic [11]"

It is currently the case in Australia that many government-funded services can only provide 18- 24 months of face-to-face care. No doubt similar services are limited in cash-strapped health systems across the world. Thus solutions need to be found urgently for interventions that supplement face-to-face care during the full period of relapse risk.

These include: • Possible cognitive deficit [14]. Patients with FEP may suffer impairment in speed of processing ranging up to severe [15] and this could indicate a broader diversity of cognitive deficits. However, the severity and pattern of cognitive deficits is unclear, and varies between individuals. • Lack of engagement [16, 17]. Patients with psychotic illness are often difficult to engage. Additionally, many teenagers are protective of their privacy and reluctant to open up to an adult therapist [17]. • Experience of stigma [18, 19].

Research suggests that psychosis sufferers like using the Internet because of its anonymity and absence of a hierarchy and its potential to assist in overcoming difficulties with social interaction [13].

In other health domains, people who use the CSM to help understand their medical condition have been found to be most interested in the effect that their condition has on their everyday life [65, p.904]. This is what compels individuals to stay engaged with online health communities: these provide opportunities to follow the ongoing progress of others.

This further promotes the trust relationship encouraged by SA, as revelation of personal information is known to promote trust [66] and an active user will likely reveal significant information to moderators. Better knowledge of users, in turn, helps alert moderators to early warning signs of relapse so the moderator can take steps to encourage users to initiate preventive measures.

Our trial participants indicated that a key factor that helped them develop trust in our system was that it is connected to a clinic with which they were already familiar. This raises the question of whether clients attending other clinics, or those who don’t have access to a clinic at all, can develop sufficient trust to fully engage.

In previous work we published data which supported the clinical success of the intervention. The earlier papers do not attempt to theorize about the use of the system and how its design influenced use. The current paper makes three new contributions: It describes in detail the principles used to develop an application for clinician moderation informed by the Supportive Accountability model; it analyzes a large body of qualitative data not dealt with in the previous publications; and it uses a body of theory to explain why users engaged with the system, and why the approach to moderation was successful. This paper explores user-appropriate design for an HCI audience, while our earlier publications addressed a psychiatric audience and focused on the efficacy of the intervention."

This parallels an increase in support for the practice of recovery in mental health care from the service user, carer and service provider community worldwide as promoted by the International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership (IIMHL, 2010). According to the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA, 2010) almost 19% of members practise in the area of mental health. This is similar to figures produced by the Association of Professional Music Therapists (APMT) in the UK where mental health related work accounts for the employment context of approximately 17% of members surveyed (2009).

Music therapy: The evidence The growing evidence base for music therapy in mental health care supports the development of the profession in modern day mental health services. A review of controlled studies concluded that music therapy is “a structured interaction that patients are able to use to participate successfully, manage some of their symptoms, and express feelings relating to their experiences” (Edwards, 2006, p. 33). Lin et al. (2011) reviewed almost 100 studies of music therapy and mental health and concluded that …music as used by music therapists results in clinical improvement. We found no demonstrable evidence that simply listening to music had the same type of result. Therefore, it may be that a purposeful and professional design for delivering music, coupled"

Music therapy is a proven beneficial intervention for people with enduring mental illness which may bring about improvements in social functioning, global state and mental state (Grocke, Castle, & Bloch, 2008). A systematic review of music therapy studies with patients who have schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses concluded that the music therapy intervention, in addition to standard care, could improve patient’s global state (Gold, Heldal, Dahle & Wigram, 2005). Research into music therapy with mental health service users has demonstrated improved symptom scores among those randomised to music therapy, especially in general symptoms of schizophrenia (Talwar, et al., 2006). The effectiveness of music therapy to reduce negative symptoms of schizophrenia has been examined. A randomized control trial showed music therapy increased patients’ ability"

The increasing evidence of the benefits of music therapy that these outcome studies have provided is a driving force for developing music therapy services in the mental health sector.

The recovery approach Described as an idea “whose time has come” (Shepherd, Boardman & Slade, 2008, p. 1) the recovery approach in mental health has become an underpinning feature of mental health policy and service in a number of countries (Shepherd et al., 2008). Based on principles that place the client and their lived experience at the heart of decision making about treatment and care, the recovery approach emphasises hope, meaningful activity and empowerment (Lloyd, Waghorn & Williams, 2008; Shepherd et al., 2008). “Belief that there is hope for a better life is a large part of the recovery orientation” (Lloyd et al., 2008, p. 325).

A person's got to work through emotion. They've got to work through stress. They've got to be able to work through voices and things that are disturbing and destructive to their lives (participant response - Happell, 2008) The recovery approach can be distinguished from what is described as clinical recovery “which implicitly assumes that, in the majority of cases, correct assessment and optimal treatment are sufficient to achieve full symptom remission. This, in turn, enables people to return, mostly without further assistance, to premorbid levels of community functioning.” (Lloyd"

As Davidson, Shahar, Lawless, Sells & Tondora (2006) suggest, recovery is positioned …in contrast to the traditional deficit–based model derived from the clinical discipline of psychopathology, recovery–oriented care is described as eliciting, fleshing out, and cultivating the positive elements of a person’s life—such as his or her assets, aspirations, hopes, and interests. (p. 151) The recovery approach in mental health maps onto a wider perspective in mental health services that has proposed the inclusion of service user voices in reviews of existing programmes and approaches as well as future decision making in policy areas. In Australia for example, an existing policy that standardized outcome measures should be used across all mental health services nationally has been criticised for its failure to include"

As described by one respondent - I think they [services] should have a belief in optimum recovery. I mean, they should look for the best possible outcome (participant response - Happell, 2008). At the same time the central concept of hope has required broader elaboration.

Recovery acknowledges that each person’s journey to wellness is unique and individual. By actively participating in treatment goals and plans people can assume a fulfilled life even when faced with the challenges of mental illness. Recovery promotes hope, positive self- image and identity, trust in self, meaning, relationships, personal resourcefulness, confidence, control and above all else it emphasizes that that the voices of people with mental illness are to be heard and respected (Mental Health Commission, 2007).

Therefore it is timely to consider the possibilities the recovery model offers within music therapy practices internationally. Music therapy can support the call of modern mental health services to reorient towards a more person centred way of working by facilitating individuals’ personal journeys while at the same time fostering respectful, empathic relationships between service users and providers (American Psychiatric Association, 2005; Department of Health and Children, 2006; Mental Health Commission, 2007). Grocke et al. (2008) have suggested that music therapy is “closely aligned to the recovery model of psychiatric care in that its emphasis is on “strengths and resources”(p. 444).

Rolvsjord (2010) proposed that resource oriented music therapy facilitates empowerment, and she distinguishes it from medical or psychoanalytical discourse. This also parallels the goals of the recovery approach that simply following the status quo is not enough to ensure quality care (Borg & Kristiansen, 2004). In the related area of arts activities in mental health, recovery has been presented as facilitated through participation in art making describing it as a strengths based approach (Van Lith, Fenner & Schofield, 2010).

Joe reported that this helped him and added that he was occasionally able to build up the confidence to play for his house mates. After three months Joe had built a repertoire, from memory, of four traditional Irish pieces which he could successfully play from beginning to end.

The review of studies pertaining to people who have severe and enduring mental illnesses recorded a “negligible” attrition level for participants (Grocke, et al., 2008, p. 444). In the experience of the authors, clients attending music therapy services do so regularly, and note that self-care frequently improves, with clients “dressing up” for sessions (Tommy Hayes, personal communication, 2008). Therefore, these aspects of potential benefits including self care and economic impact might be given consideration as a parameter for evaluation in future studies.

In conjunction with another person, playing music together mirrors all the capacities for relating that verbal interaction requires; including listening, responding, and initiation. The case reports presented here provide support for the applicability of music therapy within the recovery approach. Processes in musical interaction that make therapeutic work by a qualified music therapist particularly relevant within the recovery model still require further examination. Further case reports and case series will be needed to stimulate consideration of mechanisms by which change occurs, optimal regularity of participation in order to achieve benefits, or how long changes are sustained after cessation of sessions. 16 Conclusion Three individuals"

VAUGHAN BELL Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, De Crespigny Park, London, UK Abstract Background: Questions have been raised about the internet’s effect on mental health, although no principled review has yet tackled the issue. Aims: To examine the effect of the internet on mental health. Method: Literature review. Results: The internet is typically discussed as if it were a set of activities when it is actually a medium upon which various activities can occur. It is, therefore, neither ‘‘good’’ nor ‘‘bad’’ for mental health, although speciﬁc activities may have an inﬂuence. The standard of mental health information on the internet is probably equivalent to the mainstream media, although overall it still remains poor.

The present review evaluated the effectiveness of CBT in stressful conditions among clinical and general populations, and identified recent advances in CBT-related techniques. A search of the literature for studies conducted during 1987–2021 identified 345 articles relating to biopsychosocial medicine; 154 (45%) were review articles, including 14 systemic reviews, and 53 (15%) were clinical trials including 45 randomized controlled trials. The results of several randomized controlled trials indicated that CBT was effective for a variety of mental problems (e.g., anxiety disorder, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, depression, hypochondriasis), physical conditions (e.g., chronic"

Mental and physical problems can likely be managed effectively with online CBT or self-help CBT using a mobile app, but these should be applied with care, considering their cost-effectiveness and applicability to a given population. Keywords: Biopsychosocial approach, Cognitive–behavioral therapy, Stress management History of cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) CBT is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that helps people to identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on their behavior and emotions [1]. Under stressful conditions, some individuals tend to feel pessimistic and unable to solve problems. CBT promotes more balanced thinking to improve the ability to cope with stress.

So-called “first-wave” behavioral ther- apy was developed in the 1950s [2]. In the US, Albert El- lis founded rational emotive therapy to help clients modify their irrational thoughts when encountering problematic events, and Aaron Beck employed cognitive therapy for depressed clients using Ellison’s model [3]. Behavioral therapy and cognitive therapy were later inte- grated in terms of theory and practice, leading to the emergence of “second-wave” CBT in the 1960s. The first- and second-wave forms of CBT arose via attempts to develop well-specified and rigorous techniques based on empirically validated basic principles [4].

Recently, how- ever, a third-wave form of CBT has attracted increasing attention, leading to new treatment approaches such as acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behav- ior therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, func- tional analytic psychotherapy, and extended behavioral activation; other forms may also exist, although this is subject to conjecture [4]. In a field of psychosomatic medicine, it has been reported that cognitive restructur- ing is effective in improving psychosomatic symptoms [5], exposure therapy is suitable for a variety of anxious disease conditions like panic disorder and agoraphobia [6], and mindfulness reduces stress-related pain in fibro- myalgia [7]. Several online and personal computer-based CBT programs have also been developed, with or with- out the support of clinicians; these can also be accessed by tablets or smartphones [8]."

Most clinical trials re- cruited the samples from patient populations in order to assess specific diseases, but some targeted at those from non-patient populations like a working population in order to assessing mind-body conditions relating to sick leave [9]. The use of biopsychosocial approaches to treat chronic pain is shown to be clinically and economically efficacious [10]; for example, CBT is effective for chronic low-back pain [11].

Interestingly, according to the results of our own study [13], CBT was effective among hypochondriacal patients without chronic low-back pain, but not in hypochondriacal pa- tients with chronic low-back pain. These group differ- ences did not seem to be due to differences in the baseline levels of hypochondriasis. Although evidence has suggested that both hypochondriasis and chronic low-back pain can be treated effectively with CBT [10, 11, 14], this has not yet been validated. Chronic low- back pain may be associated with a variety of conditions, including anxiety, depression, and somatic disorders such as illness conviction, disease phobia, and bodily preoccupation.

Since 2000, Cochrane reviews have evaluated the ef- fectiveness of CBT for a variety of mental, physical, and behavioral problems. Through a search of the Cochrane Library database up to May 2021 [15], 124 disease con- ditions were assessed to clarify the effects of CBT in ran- domized controlled trials; the major conditions for which CBT showed efficacy are listed in Table 1. These include a broad range of medical problems such as psy- chosomatic illnesses (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome, ir- ritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia), psychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, and developmental disability), and socio-behavioral problems (drug abuse, smoking, and problem gambling). For most of these con- ditions, CBT proved effective in the short term after completion of the randomized controlled trial. Although the number of literature was still limited, some studies"

However, due to the high intensity of face-to-face early intervention treatments, this may not be feasible.

As we move from controlled trials with a select group of participants each having the same established mental health condition to more general, publicly used sites where users will have a variety of conditions and are not pre-known trial participants, there is also the potential to deliver therapy content particularly relevant to a certain mental health condition based on analysis of a user’s content (Bedi et al., 2015). Apart from user content analysis, other possibilities include making suggestions based on geolocation data (Dredze et al., 2013) and self-monitoring/self-sensing data (Matthews et al., 2014). Regarding the former, one example would be to determine the geographical location or event of an active user using their mobile phone, retrieve an"

Regarding the latter, one example would be to detect the onset of anxiety attacks with wrist sensor technology (Talbot, 2012; Kappas et al., 2013) and provide the user with appropriate therapy content. As discussed, we have also done some preliminary exploration into the implementation of therapy chatbots, which can simulate interactions with human beings to varying degrees of reality and will quite possibly become a mainstay of future e-mental health and help seeking web sites/applications.

For these reasons, the medical community has taken notice and attempted to include laughter therapy to more traditional therapies. Decreasing stress-making hormones found in the blood, laughter can mitigate the effects of stress. Laughter decreases serum levels of cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone, and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (a major dopamine catabolite), indicating a reversal of the stress response. Depression is a disease, where neurotransmitters in the brain, such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, are reduced, and there is something wrong in the mood control circuit of the brain. Laughter can alter dopamine and serotonin activity. Furthermore, endorphins secreted by laughter can help when people are uncomfortable or in a depressed mood.

Laughter therapy in the media has grown and many researchers have conducted a variety of studies on laughter (Cho and Oh 2011). Moreover, as laughter therapy does not require specialized preparations such as suitable facilities and equipment, is not prohibited by cost, does not depend on when or where it happens, and is easily accessible and acceptable, the medi- cal world has also introduced it into treatment programs (Mora-Ripoll 2010; Ko and Youn 2011).

As for the mental effects of the laughter ther- apy, it helps reduce unpleasant feelings such as tension, anxiety, hatred, and anger, alleviates stress and depression, aids better interpersonal relationships, and improves insom- nia, memory failure, and dementia (Takeda et al. 2010; Ko and Youn 2011; Bains et al. 2015).

Furthermore, a potential mental health problem may lead to the affected person having many difficulties in maintaining a good lifestyle at home and work life (Bast and Berry 2014). Moreover, there are many problems related to the elderly in society due to the nature of an aging J.E. Yim 244 society. In particular, problems regarding the mental health of elderly people are being magnified. Depression, second- ary to loneliness and physical discomfort due to aging, is a most important emotional problem in old age and requires social attention and positive intervention.

This disorder of cognitive function can put a high burden on a person, their family, and society as a whole. The patient, and their family, can suffer from physical and psychological stress. Laughter, as part of the solution to these mental health problems, might provide a desirable noninvasive and non-pharmacological therapy that restores their happiness, by making the human body and soul healthy, and improving quality of life and self-esteem. Theory Laughter Laughter is a physical reaction seen in humans and some other species of primates, consisting typically of rhythmic, often audible, contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to cer- tain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from activities such as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts (Stearns 1972; Schultz and Horibe 1974).

Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situa- tion (Omwake 1937). Dr. Miletus in the 4th century said, Laughter is gelos in Greek, and the root of this word is Hele, which means Health.; philosophers in the 16th century, Laughing is also like taking physical exercise.; Kant in the 18th century, Laughter has a great influence on keeping balance in physi- cal health.; Spencer in the 19th century, Laughter helps ease tension and recover health (Dean and Gregory 2004; Hyeong Woo 2010).

Laughter is the expression of one’s joyful heart or feeling when their desire is satisfied; it can be a spontaneous expression of their emotion when they have a joyful feeling or heart, physical stimulus or pleasure, or a heart or feeling physi- cally arousing when they feel ridiculous of an odd word, behavior or appearance.

Laughter Theories There are three categories in the theories of laughter: arousal, discrepancy, and superiority (Apte 1985; Lefcourt and Martin 2012). First, the arousal theory is concerned with the cognitive aspects of laughter; stress increases arousal, while laughter is able to reduce stress by easing arousal and tension. This theory says if people laugh in a stressful situation their physical arousal state declines and the stressful situation is no longer as negative or detestable. That is to say, the theory suggests that laughter shows a complicated interaction of mind and body between cogni- tion and emotion, rooted in the brain and nervous system. Freud (1928) also considered laughter as a mechanism that can block the attacks of another, and stated that it reduces negative emotional responses or unpleasant feelings"

Second, discrepancy theory is concerned with the cognitive aspect, which says laughter starts from the dith- ered process, situation, or thought apart from the knowledge or logic that people commonly know. This theory says peo- ple laugh when they realize there is discrepancy between the actual situation and their general knowledge of it. The theory has a viewpoint emphasizing logical, linguistic, and cognitive aspects. Laughter happens at the moment misun- derstanding and bewilderment arouse in communication, deviating from the smooth course of the cognitive process. Laughter occurs at the moment cognitive imbalance — that is, the point of discrepancy or disharmony — disappears and balance recovers. Laughter at this moment is an expression of pleasant enlightenment. According to the dis- crepancy theory, people can laugh not only when they meet something different from their expectation but also when they meet something in discord with their expectation (Keith-Spiegel 1972)."

The theory says laughter restricts the external environment and raises confi- dence (MacGhee and Pistolesi 1979). By raising content- ment without going against the grain, laughter allows peo- ple to take adequate action against stress and increases confidence (Martin 2010). Categories of Laughter Five large categories can be summarized from a medi- cal and therapeutic point of view: (1) genuine or spontane- ous laughter; (2) simulated laughter; (3) stimulated laugh- ter; (4) induced laughter; and (5) pathological laughter (Table 1).

Laughter Therapy Laughter therapy is a kind of communication that arouses laughter, smiling, pleasant feelings, and enables interaction. Laughter therapy uses laughter for the purpose of treatment to promote leading a desirable life, by keeping, recovering, and preventing physical, psychological, social, mental and spiritual functions through spontaneous and nonspontaneous laughter (Mora-Ripoll 2010). This is a dif- ferent approach from general medical treatments; it focuses on the approach that both body and mind can be healthy only when the psychological aspects of the brain are changed, beyond just physical treatment.

Unlike the tempo- rary depressed feeling, depression does not vary according to situation and can continue for years if not cured (Caspi et al. 2003).

To improve mental health services for people of color, professionals have emphasized the need for cultural congruence between therapists and clients (Pope-Davis, Coleman, Liu, & Toporek, 2003; Smith, 2009). Matching therapists with clients of the same ethnicity is one aspect of practice that has received sustained attention across several decades (e.g., Møllersen, Sexton, & Holte, 2009; Sue, Fujino, Hu, Takeuchi, & Zane, 1991).

This presumption has sound theoretical underpinnings in social psychology. Worldview similarity fosters interpersonal attraction (Byrne, 1971). People tend to be attracted to those who share similar perceived physical attributes (e.g., Berscheid, Dion, Walster, & Walster, 1971). People typically associate with those they perceive to be similar to themselves (Newcomb, 1961).

According to theories of consensus bias (i.e., Ross, Greene, & House, 1977; Marks & Miller, 1987), people tend to perceive their own judgments as being shared by others and alternative perspectives as being unusual or even unacceptable, such that perceptions of similarity with others are normative when contradictory information is unavailable. People typically presume similarity with others (Robbins & Kreuger, 2005) unless differences are brought to attention, such as by physical appearance differences across race/ethnicity.

If the therapeutic alliance is likely strengthened under conditions of interpersonal similarity, then it stands to reason that client outcomes in therapy should also benefit. Indeed there is some research evidence that similarities in the values of client and therapist predict positive client outcome (Kelly & Strupp, 1992). Racial/ethnic matching may therefore improve client outcomes by enhancing mutual understanding between client and therapist and by reducing client concerns about being misunderstood or Running head: ETHNIC MATCHING 6 mistreated (e.g., Kohatsu et al., 2000). At a more pragmatic level, it seems reasonable that shared social networks and shared community structures may also enhance therapist awareness of accessible resources and sources of support.

Even when therapist and client share ethnic backgrounds, interpersonal differences remain on other variables (socioeconomic status, religion, etc.). Thus a presumption of similarity (based on race alone) may result in disappointment, particularly when client and therapist have incongruous values. This difference between expected vs. actual similarity could weaken the degree to which meeting clients’ preferences for racial/ethnic matching translates into improved therapeutic outcomes. Studies of client preferences tap into projected imagination; potential clients asked by a researcher about their racial/ethnic preferences likely imagine a therapist who also shares their own gender, political opinions, etc. Thus studies of individuals’ preferences may blur the issue of racial/ethnic similarity with overall interpersonal similarity.

Data specific to African American clients indicated minimal effects of racial/ethnic matching on drop out, number of sessions attended, and post- treatment functioning (d’s = -.19, -.01, and -.28, respectively).

For instance, White/European American clients may implicitly expect to see a therapist of their own race and may therefore initially mistrust a therapist of color, but this possibility has not yet been confirmed. In contrast, research has consistently shown that African American clients tend to mistrust mental health services provided by White/European American therapists (O’Sullivan, Peterson, Cox, & Kirkeby, 1989; Snowden, 1999; Sue, 1977; Sussman, Robins, & Earls, 1987). Explanations for this finding include the possibility of a perceived racial bias in the provision of mental health services and the implicit association of mental health services with the values of White/European Americans (Maultsby, 1982; Ridley, 1984). Moreover, racial mistrust among African Americans is moderately associated with their psychosocial functioning (Whaley, 2001).

Although conclusions vary somewhat, studies tend to support racial/ethnic matching as being particularly useful for African American clients. The limited literature investigating the effects of racial/ethnic matching with other racial/ethnic minority groups has yielded mixed results (Karlsson, 2005). For example, Running head: ETHNIC MATCHING 10 some evidence indicates that Asian Americans may sometimes prefer White/European American therapists due to internalized racism by Asian Americans (Alvarez & Helms, 2001). Results of studies of the preference for racial/ethnic matching among Asian Americans have been inconsistent (Atkinson, Maruyama, & Matsui, 1978; Atkinson & Matsushita, 1991; Atkinson, Poston, Furlong, & Mercado, 1989).

Inconsistency of findings has led some influential scholars to conclude that clients of different racial/ethnic groups should benefit equally from therapy, regardless of whether or not they are racially/ethnically matched with their therapist (i.e., Lambert et al., 2006).

Moreover, the results of this meta-analysis clarify some mixed results noted in previous studies (i.e., Atkinson, 1983; Atkinson, Maruyama, & Matsui, 1978; Karlsson, 2005). Although Asian Americans may not express strong initial preferences for a therapist based on race, they appear to perceive Asian American therapists more positively than other therapists. The opposite trend was noted for Hispanic/Latino(a) Americans, whose expressed preferences for therapists of the same ethnic background were strong, but whose evaluations of therapists differed only slightly as a function of racial/ethnic match. Overall, the pattern of different findings across the three types of variables (preference, perception, and outcome) can be explained in part by the nature of those variables.

Client outcome is by far the most complicated variable, with dozens if not hundreds of factors impacting it, only some of which would relate to therapist characteristics. Thus the effect of racial/ethnic matching appears to be diminished as more variables become involved. Common factors are more predictive of client outcome than specific treatment variables (Messer & Wampold, 2002), including therapist race/ethnicity.

Racial/ethnic matching is a proxy variable for worldview matching (e.g., Zane et al., 2005). More than two decades after Sue and Zane’s (1987) proposal to shift the focus from distal to proximal variables in research involving race/ethnicity, that advice still seems cogent.

Thus the omnibus results lack precision and should be considered as broad trends, rather than conclusive predictors of individuals’ responses.

To control for these possible confounds, future research should randomly assign clients to matched vs. unmatched conditions and explicitly account for attrition. An interesting finding suggested the possibility of a shift over time in client preferences, with recent studies demonstrating preferences of lower magnitude compared with studies conducted in previous decades.

Implications for Practice Even though we live in a multicultural society, with greater diversity than ever before, the practice of matching clients with therapists of the same race/ethnicity is not often feasible. Moreover, if agencies were to adopt rigid policies about matching clients with therapists of the same racial/ethnic background, unintended negative consequences might result (Alladin, 2002).

The sample included six peer- nominated experienced therapists, trained at the masters or doctoral level, who self-identified as having managed well in this work. Narrative data was collected through interviews with individual co-participants, who were asked, \"How do you manage to sustain your personal and professional wellbeing, given the challenges of your work with seriously traumatized clients?\" Data analysis was based upon Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach, and Zilber's (1998) typology"

The risks of working directly with traumatized individuals on a regular basis are well documented within the literature. Counsellors and other mental health professionals may experience physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms, (e.g. physical pain and agitation, emotional distress, disrupted beliefs, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts and images) similar to those of their traumatized clients (Arvay, 2001; Figley, 2002; McCann & Pearlman, 1990; Sexton, 1999).

To date, very little is known about the success and satisfaction of trauma therapists who are able to manage in the workplace despite the potentially noxious demands of their work. Who are the respected, experienced professionals who succeed in this work and remain healthy? How and why do they carry on? Salston and Figley (2003) state 1 2 that the most important and least studied variables predicting VT are \"a sense of satisfaction for working with the traumatized and the ability (or competence) in creating distance between the worker and"

The purpose of the study was to gain and share knowledge about these protective practices. The ultimate goal of the study is to contribute to the prevention of VT. This research has implications for the training, counselling practice, supervision, and support of counsellors who are working with increasingly complex client populations. Many people enter the fields of counselling, social work, and psychology without ample awareness of the costs of caring.

When individuals trained in the helping professions abandon the field, due to a perceived burden of caring and an insufficient ability to balance work with other aspects of life, this constitutes an enormous loss of resources and potential. When therapists continue working, despite suffering from the damaging effects of VT, this constitutes a tremendous disservice to both clients and helpers, and the health of our community is undermined. It was imperative to address these concerns on ethical grounds, as practitioners and researchers alike must strive to provide appropriate, effective care for traumatized clients as well as those who work with them. There is a social cost to ignoring these issues.

This approach to research involves \"in-depth study of particular individuals in social context and in time\" (Josselson, 2003, p.4), and integrates a careful, systematic study of phenomena with the literary deconstruction of texts and hermeneutic analyses of meanings. Narrative analysis combines a discursive emphasis on how meanings are constructed through language and utterances along with an attention to the participant's personal agency and self-awareness in their efforts to attribute meaning and achieve fulfillment in their lives. It is concerned with the multiplicity of voices within texts, the co- constructed nature of interviews, figurative use of language,"

Vicarious Traumatization Over the past 15 years, researchers and theorists have given increasing attention to the construct of Vicarious Traumatization (VT), defined by Pearlman and Mac Ian (1995) as \"the transformation that occurs within the therapist (or trauma worker) as a result of empathic engagement with clients' trauma experiences and their sequelae\" (p. 558). McCann and Pearlman (1990) first identified and conceptualized VT as an interactive, cumulative, and inevitable process, distinct from burnout or conntertransference. They posited that all therapists working with survivors of trauma experience pervasive and enduring alterations in cognitive schema that impact the trauma worker's feelings, relationships, and life. Whether these changes are destructive to the therapist and to the therapeutic process, depends, according to these authors, largely on the extent to which the helper is able to engage in her or his own process of integration and transformation of clients' horrific traumatic material.

Furthermore, the therapist is the locus of origin for countertransference, which is based upon preexisting personal characteristics of the helper (inner qualities, psychological makeup, etc.) and is understood to be an intrusion of a therapist's own unresolved material, including previous trauma experiences, retaliatory or aggressive fantasies, etc. In contrast, traumatic experiences in the client's life account for therapist VT.

Both the nature of trauma work and personal characteristics of individual therapists contribute to vicarious traumatization of therapists. The latter include: therapists' high ideals, over-identification with clients, over- investment in meeting clients' every need, rescue fantasies, inadequate self-care, and inadequate training and supervision, all of which can contribute to VT.

This results in unrealistic and unmanageably high caseloads, which adversely affects morale in many of the work settings in which you interface. This could be prevented if more people were recruited into the community mental health field, because therapists would not be under such pressure to absorb extra responsibilities, such as coverage and data entry, which cut into the time required to do a good job with clients.

If I Had to Sum it Up My understanding is that awareness is key to your professional and personal wellbeing. Mindful living helps you to recognize signs of physical exhaustion and emotional distancing that indicate when your work is intruding upon your personal life. You have many strategies for dealing with this risk, including physical and emotional self-care practices, and accessing 88 supervision, peer support, and personal therapy.

To the contrary, several talked about being particularly attentive to those times when clients' stories resonated more closely with the therapist's own personal history. At such times they were inclined to seek out help in the form of supervision, because they did not want their own strong feelings about emotionally charged personal life events to risk interfering with their ability to remain fully present and empathically attuned in their work with clients. These trauma therapists did not confuse clients' experiences with their own, nor did they confuse empathy with sympathy or emotional fusion.

Although these narrative research findings cannot be generalized beyond the population of the research sample, the knowledge generated in the current study may well be helpful to some other practitioners who work with traumatized clients, both in counselling psychology and related fields. However, future research is needed to explore whether these findings are applicable within other (e.g., non-western) cultural contexts, particularly findings with regard to interpersonal boundaries. In addition, I did not ask participants whether they had a personal history of trauma when gathering demographic information. Consequently, this study does not help elucidate whether a therapist's previous trauma history is a risk factor for or serves as a buffer against VT (Buchanan et al., 2006). Moreover, the narrative research design provides no grounds for comparison between groups, as might a study whose design included a different method, for example involving a"

Most surprisingly, the study yielded the novel finding that exquisite empathy can be a protective practice for trauma therapists, thereby challenging prior assumptions that empathic engagement puts therapist at increased risk for VT. In addition, the current research provides initial evidence confirming of many recommendations for coping with VT that were previously based on informal observation. My research findings further extend the VT story and contribute to the field by introducing evidence of a new concept, Vicarious PTG, into the discourse of trauma therapy. The research also offers an important contribution through its illumination of the beneficial role that mindfulness practice and related presence can play in the cultivation of personal"

The sample included six peer- nominated experienced therapists, trained at the masters or doctoral level, who self-identified as having managed well in this work. Narrative data was collected through interviews with individual co-participants, who were asked, \"How do you manage to sustain your personal and professional wellbeing, given the challenges of your work with seriously traumatized clients?\" Data analysis was based upon Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach, and Zilber's (1998) typology"

The research findings yielded twelve major themes that describe protective practices engaged by exemplary trauma therapists: countering isolation (in professional, personal and spiritual realms); developing mindful self awareness; consciously expanding perspective to embrace complexity; openness to the unknown; sustaining and renewing hope; active optimism and problem solving; holistic self-care; maintaining clear boundaries; invoking imagery, metaphor, and ritual; exquisite empathy; professional satisfaction; and creating meaning. The novel finding that empathic engagement with traumatized clients appeared to be protective challenges previous conceptualizations of VT and points to exciting new directions for research and theory, as well as applications to practice. Participants also described experiences of vicarious post-traumatic growth. The findings confirm and extend previous recommendations for ameliorating VT and underscore the ethical responsibility shared by employers, educators, professional bodies, and individual practitioners to create time and"

The risks of working directly with traumatized individuals on a regular basis are well documented within the literature. Counsellors and other mental health professionals may experience physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms, (e.g. physical pain and agitation, emotional distress, disrupted beliefs, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts and images) similar to those of their traumatized clients (Arvay, 2001; Figley, 2002; McCann & Pearlman, 1990; Sexton, 1999).

To date, very little is known about the success and satisfaction of trauma therapists who are able to manage in the workplace despite the potentially noxious demands of their work. Who are the respected, experienced professionals who succeed in this work and remain healthy? How and why do they carry on?

The purpose of the study was to gain and share knowledge about these protective practices. The ultimate goal of the study is to contribute to the prevention of VT. This research has implications for the training, counselling practice, supervision, and support of counsellors who are working with increasingly complex client populations.

When individuals trained in the helping professions abandon the field, due to a perceived burden of caring and an insufficient ability to balance work with other aspects of life, this constitutes an enormous loss of resources and potential. When therapists continue working, despite suffering from the damaging effects of VT, this constitutes a tremendous disservice to both clients and helpers, and the health of our community is undermined. It was imperative to address these concerns on ethical grounds, as practitioners and researchers alike must strive to provide appropriate, effective care for traumatized clients as well as those who work with them. There is a social cost to ignoring these issues. Research Questions The questions that I explored are: 3 1) How do exemplary (i.e., healthy, effective, satisfied) trauma therapists experience and practice sustainability and personal wellness in their work with traumatized clients? 2) How might protective"

Research Design I used a narrative method of inquiry and analysis to explore these research questions (Arvay, 2003, Freeman, 1997, McLeod, 2001). This approach to research involves \"in-depth study of particular individuals in social context and in time\" (Josselson, 2003, p.4), and integrates a careful, systematic study of phenomena with the literary deconstruction of texts and hermeneutic analyses of meanings. Narrative analysis combines a discursive emphasis on how meanings are constructed through language and utterances along with an attention to the participant's personal agency and self-awareness in their efforts to attribute meaning and achieve fulfillment in their lives. It is concerned with the multiplicity of voices within texts, the co- constructed nature of interviews, figurative use of language,"

McCann and Pearlman (1990) first identified and conceptualized VT as an interactive, cumulative, and inevitable process, distinct from burnout or conntertransference. They posited that all therapists working with survivors of trauma experience pervasive and enduring alterations in cognitive schema that impact the trauma worker's feelings, relationships, and life. Whether these changes are destructive to the therapist and to the therapeutic process, depends, according to these authors, largely on the extent to which the helper is able to engage in her or his own process of integration and transformation of clients' horrific traumatic material.

Furthermore, the therapist is the locus of origin for countertransference, which is based upon preexisting personal characteristics of the helper (inner qualities, psychological makeup, etc.) and is understood to be an intrusion of a therapist's own unresolved material, including previous trauma experiences, retaliatory or aggressive fantasies, etc. In contrast, traumatic experiences in the client's life account for therapist VT.

Both the nature of trauma work and personal characteristics of individual therapists contribute to vicarious traumatization of therapists. The latter include: therapists' high ideals, over-identification with clients, over- investment in meeting clients' every need, rescue fantasies, inadequate self-care, and inadequate training and supervision, all of which can contribute to VT.

He proposed the existence of secondary traumatic stress disorder (STSD), a syndrome of symptoms that parallel those of PTSD, among those who care for victims of trauma. In the case of STSD, the primary exposure to traumatic events by one person becomes the traumatizing event for the second person. Figley (1995) equated STS with \"the 'cost of caring' (Figley, 1982) for others in emotional pain\" (p. 9) that has led researchers and therapists to abandon their work with traumatized persons.

Younger therapists, and those with less than a master's degree were found to be more vulnerable.

Screening Potential co-participants were invited to an initial, structured, screening interview, in which I explained the purpose of the study and confirmed that they met all eligibility criteria. I also asked them to complete a short quantitative measure, the Professional Quality of Life: Compassion Fatigue and Satisfaction Subscales, R-III (Pro-QOL) (Stamm, 2003).

Rather, I view it as a subjective, situated, co-constructed, text. However, because much of the prior research and theory on VT sits within a post-positivist research epistemology, it is my hope that including this measure as a screening criterion might contribute to a greater dialogue between the findings from this study and the research that has preceded it.

I also gathered information about each co- participant's age, work setting, caseload, years and range of experience with traumatized clients.
