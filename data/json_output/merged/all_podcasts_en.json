How do people relate to each other? What causes prejudice? Can prejudice be reduced by any intervention? Can education help? These are really vital issues throughout history and certainly and vital today as they've ever been. Oh, yeah, I might add to that that the center of social psychology has always been considered to be social influence.

By studying social psychology, we understand how people think, how they feel, what makes them happy, what makes them sad, how they justify their own behavior, they justify their mistakes, how a great many people, especially those in politics, tend to justify their mistakes and how that leads them to make deeper and deeper mistakes.

This was before you had a cell phone or a smartphone to entertain you and the lights were hard.

You think we really should not include as staples anymore in a social psychology class? That's a good question for us because we revise every five years. And we have to decide what is true, you know, what is currently considered true? And it's been wrenching to pull some of those great studies out.

And it wasn't pulled off well. So that there are some serious methodological flaws in that experiment.

And Jigsaw came in and made it good for some of the kids. I was kind of in the control group. So it was lousy in my control group. Kids in Jigsaw were learning to like each other, learning to respect each other, see across racial lines and",

So my school, it's actually the oldest boarding school in America. And we bought it because it was struggling. And the vision was to take the world's poorest children and mix them together with the world's wealthiest children. And this is my, I have a billionaire friend who is making this all happen. And so he's asked me to help him design this school. And it's really a school based on social psychological principles. And Jigsaw gave me the confidence that it would work. So in social psych, I think of there being a bunch of social motives. And we all see them in front of us. It's like you want to belong,",

All of those things, and the work you're doing makes a difference. Most schools frustrate most of those motives. And that's why we're seeing a lot of the problems. You go into a school where everybody feels like they belong, they understand what the work they're doing and they understand why they're doing it. In other words, they understand the importance of what they're doing. If they feel like they trust their teachers, they get some autonomy, but also connectedness to other people.

So what it's the elegant solution to that problem is, like Jigsaw, is that you get kids working together on not just learning some material, but by producing a three-dimensional something that serves another human being. So in the case of the school that I was studying, kids learn math by raising chickens. And there is so much math involved in raising a chicken that you wouldn't get from a worksheet.

And this is the kids that get the highest test scores and go on to go to college. And they're from the end up feeding the chickens. No, they keep the chickens as pets, and the chickens lay the eggs. I have lots of pictures of kids. Any time in the school that you're upset, you can go out into the playground and pick up a chicken and hold it. And there's other animals, too.

I was already pretty good, but when I started studying schools that worked and how they worked, I started applying some of these, the lessons of kindergarten and first grade to my college class and it started working really well. And the thing that I learned about these great schools was that they try to learn everything they can about each student and then knowing them makes a better teacher for them.

So, it's a pattern that goes through all of the different chapters. As one example, just as one belief that drains us is whenever I've asked audiences, how many people are a self-critical? Almost every single person raises their hand. And as you know, self-criticism, the psychological definition is that it's a form of self-loathing.

Just like a child will feel their emotions 100% and then it moves through them just like so going back to that theme of energy.

So yeah, one thing we think is happening is this is that as the veterans are doing their breathing practice, they go into this deep parisepathetic state of just calm.

And so and they're not able to sleep for that reason. They're constantly in high activation. And what happens with the breathing we believe is that as they're going into this parisepathetic state and the memory may be coming up, there's like a decoupling that happens between the physiological activation and the memory. And so what they have said to us is I remember everything that happened, but I can move on. And they get off, got off their meds, their sleep meds, anxiety meds, you know,",

And so that's how I became interested in that. I think there is a really interesting question about, there are so many interesting questions. One is how much of what we're seeing is not fake.

Yeah, I have the videographer who took the footage of Haley, which I mean, that was like 12 years ago on now, or 11 years ago now.

Two, three standard views above the mean in implicit learning ability in statistical learning, discovering some of these really complex statistical patterns that are associated with thoughts.

Okay, that would be controversial, that there's some kind of designer. What it actually means, and this is a familiar term in physics, is just that for life to be possible, these numbers had to fall in a certain very narrow range. I mean, let's take an example, put an example on the table. One of the most discussed cases is the cosmological constant that measures the force that propels the accelerating expansion of the universe. We discovered in 1998. I remember, actually, as a young kid interested in black holes and so on. We discovered that our universe is not only expanding, but it's accelerating in its expansion. When you calculate what the number is, that governs the force, we call it dark energy, the postulated",

So, if a life to be possible, that number had to be kind of like Goldilocks porridge, not too big, not too small, kind of exactly right, or not, you know, it's not one number that's needed, but it's in a quite narrow range.

They may change that you'll get less fine tuning. They may change that you'll get more fine tuning, but I think, you know, we've got to work with the evidence we currently have. What follows from that is another question, but just let me let me say, I am inclined, honestly, to think we're kind of sort of in denial about this as a society.

Right. He distinguishes the easy problems, so called and the hard problem. So the easy problems are kind of to do with behavior or information processing. What stuff does and science knows how to deal with that. You postulate a mechanism to explain the behavior. But Charmers thinks those kind of things always leave open the hard problem.

If experience and behavior are sort of logically separable, why do they fit together so well? I mean, the most obvious examples are pleasure and pain. When something hurts, you avoid it. And that's kind of appropriate. If something feels bad, that gives you a reason to avoid it. If something feels good, you tend to go for it. And that makes sense as well.

And I don't think evolution does it because, I mean, I think, I look, I believe in evolution. I think we evolved the consciousness we have. But I think any evolutionary explanation of our consciousness presupposes what I'm talking about presupposes, that behavior and consciousness go together in a kind of rationally appropriate way. Like, natural selection is only going to make me feel pain when my body's damaged.

Well, this is, what are you now? After the book, after the book, in the book, I was nothing. After the book, I've slowly come to embrace what I call heretical Christianity.

But yeah, so, I mean, this started really learning much more about actually how the Eastern Orthodox Church thinks about things, whether it's much less of an emphasis on sin, and there's much more of an emphasis on unity.

But this idea that, you know, it's all about God and the universe coming into harmony, makes a lot more sense to me on both levels.

So this is, so this is something, let me just say very finally, I am very uncertain. This is true, but I've come to think of it as a credible possibility because I think it fits well with this God of limited powers hypothesis because it kind of resonates spiritually.

That there's good evidence that there is some kind of purpose or goal directedness going on. There's something going on. Yeah. But what it is, I'm much less certain about this, this form of mildly heretical Christianity. I've come to think is a credible possibility, but I'm very open to the possibility that other religions might also be credible possibilities.

You know, Tom Holland, wonderful book Dominion on the impact of Christianity and history makes an interesting point that like in the early days of Christianity, that the rules on no sex before marriage were really bloody important because they protected women and slaves from getting raped. I mean, not entirely, obviously not entirely at all, but to an extent it protected people who have no rights. So maybe we need to rethink Christian sexual ethics as Christians.

We'll be doing a deep scientific dive trying to answer the age-old question. Do nice guys really finish last? At the core of this question is the so-called nice guy paradox. The nice guy paradox can be stated like this. On the one hand, there's a common perception that in terms of sexual prowess and romantic relationships, nice guys finish last. On the other hand, although women often portray themselves as wanting to date kind, sensitive, and emotionally expressive men, when actually presented with a choice between this quote nice guy and an unkind, insensitive, emotionally closed, macho man or jerk, they almost always seem to reject the nice guy in favor of his more macho competitor.

Well, I'm referring to the widely known fact that women habitually date men that are jerks while the quote nice guys are often left twiddling their thumbs in solitaire.

Yet, research shows over and over again that those who score high and dark personality characteristics have many more sexual partners, and heck, the media loves these kinds of headlines, immediately translating correlations into causation. For instance, consider this article from the independent reporting on a correlation between being bad and number of sexual partners.

The researchers found that there were a number of different explanations for why nice guys are perceived as sexually inexperienced. One reason some women suggested was that nice guys are simply less forward with women. One wrote, to me, nice guys aren't as persistent or aggressive and don't use sleazy tactics to add another notch to their bedposts.

Look, these are college-aged women in this study, between the ages of 18 and 25 years at one university writing these responses. So the findings must be taken with a grain of salt. Women at different stages of their life and with different life experiences may have different conceptions of, as well as interest, in quote bad boys and quote nice guys. Still, this research",

However, when it came to purely sexual relationships, a different pattern emerged. Uh oh. In these cases, niceness was less influential than physical attractiveness. As the researchers note, quote, it may be that the nice guy stereotype is more accurate in relation to relatively casual physical relationships than to more serious relationships. Still, the overall results of these studies suggest that although niceness may be less essential in these relationships, it still should not be a major hindrance,",

College students, most college students have not had the years of expertise that enable them to achieve success in a domain. This is important to keep in mind because the attainment of social status and the mating benefits that come along with it can be accomplished through compassion and cooperation just as much, if not more so, than through aggression and intimidation. Just looking at the social structure of grade school, it's easy to assume that dominance is the only route to social status.

Many scholars across ethnography, mythology, sociology, and social linguistics believe that two main routes to social status, dominance and prestige arose in evolutionary history at different times and for different purposes. In the field of psychology, self-reported measures of dominance and prestige are being distinguished at both the behavioral level and the hormonal level. As I noted in my article, The Myth of the Alpha Male, published in 2014 on the Art of Manliness website, Alpha Men are not always the most physically dominant and aggressive.

Christine, Stanik and colleagues found that finding out potential partners were rejected by their last partner negatively affected their desire to pursue a relationship with them.

Relationships with good guys may take more time to develop, but may ultimately be more satisfying and exciting. If you're looking for a long-term relationship, don't put so much stock in your initial attraction and be open-minded to guys who may not be as flashy at first sight.

Longer or shorter strides, non-lateral weight shifts, gestured versus postural movements and foot movement. Potential victims tended to lift their feet higher while walking. A key factor in victimization seems to be non-verbal cues of dominance for submissiveness. We don't want to victim-bleen here, but I think knowledge is power. So can anything be done?

So yeah. And I think in this day and age of social media, we're all more vulnerable to getting addicted to other people because the medium itself has distilled human relationships down into their most addictive components. So we know that, for example, oxytocin, the love hormone is released when we have an intimate connection to another human being. It's involved in mother pair bonding and love bonding.

And sometimes the problem is just an opportunity cost, the things I'm not doing, because I'm spending so much time watching YouTube. So we try to lay out those things. And then the A of the dopamine acronym stands for abstinence and asceticism. Abstinence is where we ask them to do a 30-day dopamine fast from their drug of choice.

And people can make it the full 30 days. They find that they feel so much better, not just better than they did when they were going to keep with draw, but actually better than they have in a really long time.

We're waiting for them to be motivated for action. Sometimes you just have to say, you know what? That's not going to come.

And then those dopamine levels will stay elevated, even hours after we stop exercise, before coming back down to baseline levels, without going into that dopamine deficit state, that sets up the craving, which is why most of us don't crave exercise the next day. We have to remind ourselves, oh, wait, I feel better after exercise. So the aesthetic sense is leaning into right-sized pain in order to upregulate dopamine levels.

And of course, we have all of this technology that takes things that used to be good for us and has turned them into something that's essentially addictive.

So this is a great opportunity to practice mindfulness as you know, and as you teach all the time, mindfulness is a skill that we can learn and practice.

Oftentimes they're very surprised at how much better they feel. Some don't feel better, and that's information too.

Using tools from psychology and neuroscience, he and his colleagues examine how empathy works and how people can learn to empathize more effectively. In this episode, we take a deep dive into the content of his new book, Hope for Sinek's, the surprising science of human goodness. We discuss his idea of hopeful skepticism and how it's different from naive optimism. According to Dr. Zaki, hopeful skepticism honors humanity's strengths while confronting our weaknesses head on.

If I can't have hope in people, given what I do, how could others?

It is completely understandable, given so many trends that we see in our culture. So one thing that we see, for instance, in the data, is that cynicism tends to track inequality.

Yeah, it often does. And the opposite of cynicism is not optimism, right? Or is not blind optimism or, you know, on optimism not grounded in truth, right? So what is the opposite of cynicism? Let me just ask you that question. Yeah, it's a great question and it depends who you ask, right?

And 85% of people think that cynics are socially smarter that they'll be better at spotting liars, for instance, than non-synics. But it turns out that basically the opposite is true. You know, cynicism is stereotyped as really smart and wise. But it's really not. A cynics actually do less well in cognitive tests than non-synics.

Skepticism is not thinking like a lawyer, not having a conclusion about people that you're trying to defend, but thinking like a scientist, being open to what people have to show you. And in that way, skeptics are able to learn more quickly and they're able to be more accurate about the world around them. I love that.

And, you know, it's looking at things with fresh eyes also knowing that a lot of the information that we have gotten so far, although compelling is just not accurate. You know, you talked about people connecting across identity differences, you know, which is a huge source of cynicism in our culture. It turns out that a lot of the intel that we are fed about people who are different from us is just playing wrong. And if you go on social media or look at the news, you will receive a",

And the evidence is clear that they're not. So I think it's, on the one hand, hopeful skepticism requires, as you rightly say, looking at the world with fresh eyes, but it also requires interrogating and understanding to use a sort of statistical term that are priors, our assumptions are based usually on bad intel, not bad in that it's negative, bad in that it's inaccurate.

And of course, if you live in a place which is highly competitive and people are assholes to each other, as you say, then that's going to bring out that side of you. You know, interestingly though, Scott, the time that people are at least cynical is when they focus on their local environments. So for instance, if you ask people, can most people be trusted? People are pretty negative. You know, only about a third of Americans think most people can be trusted. In some countries, it's like 6% of people believe most people can",

If you ask people what would it be like if you express gratitude to your friend? They say oh that would be awkward too. There's all these forecasts that we have where we think conversations will go poorly. And I think that's because we underestimate how friendly and warm and open other people are. We think that they don't want to contact with us. And so when we overcome that cynicism, we open new doors to improving our social health in ways",

But oftentimes we pay a lot less attention to the good stuff. And that's, you know, it makes sense from a survival perspective. It's safe to ignore a sunset but not a tsunami, right? We have to focus on threats. But it's tragic for our lives psychologically. And so savoring is just, it's related to gratitude but different.

A reciprocity mindset is an attempt to understand and own our influence on other people. One feature of cynicism, but really, as you know, Scott of social psychology more generally, is that we tend to stereotype other people. We tend to imagine that when they act a certain way, it's just because of who they are, not because of the situation that they're in, even though situations exert vast power over how people behave.

This is what economists call earned trust. So with my graduate student, Eric Neumann, we examine, well, what happens if you explain that to people? What happens if you tell people, hey, you know, your decision to trust is not just about the risk that you take on in a social situation. Your trust is a gift that you give to somebody else and one that they are likely to repay.

Social shark attacks are, again, this idea that we focus more on the negative than the positive. And so we overestimate the likelihood of negative events.

We're not interested. And that's the big gap in the literature. So we then did a study of the younger children now. Yeah. And it was just fascinating. What's some of the main findings?

But we're able to like get grounded again and the parents are able to no matter how hard it was. And so we did play interviews with the children where we gave them blocks. And we had to give them airplanes and ambulances. But we also gave them animals. So they could play with whatever they wanted.

And his definition of self-regulation is not inhibiting emotions. It really is about using it and channeling it contextually. Appropriate. Is that how you see so far? Absolutely. Because emotions are partly mostly what make us human. Right? We connect. It's how we feel ourselves. It's how we feel others. In a way, it's everything.

We change them because we don't expect them to handle those emotions. Toddlers have a big range of emotions.

So there's obviously the part of that connecting with the child as a parent, but also developing in the child, the social skills, so they're developing with other kids, you know, positively. How important is it for children to develop these social skills for like, how important is it really? Yeah. Yeah. It's a great question.

Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. There doesn't need to be a financial kind of reason behind it. I think I got into improv in the first place.

And so the first of these, the peer instinct, we can recognize that in us today, it's the, it's the sideways glances at our classmates, our co-workers, our neighbors, and the impulse to, match their behavior and mesh with them and be similar. And this meshing instinct gave us the gift of coordination. When a group can act as a united force, it's more efficient at foraging. It's more efficient at self-defense.

Why addressing our emotional foundation is one of the most important parts of healing and fulfillment, and how we can challenge the instinct to trust the negative beliefs we hold for ourselves.

And so it definitely feels good in the moment. So there's no denying that. But it's not long term and it's not sustainable. Yeah, it's definitely sustainable or else it wouldn't be called toxic. Yes.

So that's something I want to say is you know, healthy productivity shouldn't just become another thing you compare yourself to with others. Yeah, love that. Yeah, the best healthy product. Exactly. Like, oh, they're healthier than me. I have to change this and I'm not good enough and all of that stuff.

So is your productivity coming from a desire to mask shame? Or is it coming from a desire to genuinely learn about the world? Right? So your intention and the root matters. That's what defines, I think, the difference a little bit. And healthy productivity, I think, to me, is a different definition. It includes rest. It includes stepping away. It includes boundaries. It includes all of these things. When we are in toxic productivity, we are trying to earn rest. But healthy productivity has rest baked into the process itself. And finally, it's more process oriented than outcome or progress oriented. Kent and toxic productivity still be productive. Oh, yeah. I heard an interview with Elon Musk once.

If you're productive, you're productive. If you're not, then you're idle and lazy. Right? And so we get so scared. And so that creates a lot of fear and shame. But another thing I'll say is productivity on its own is not a bad thing. Progress is important. That's how our culture moves. That's how we have innovation.

And then if things are happening, you can rise to the occasion. Because if you're like that all the time, you are likely going to burn out. Yeah, when I was reading your book, I really thought of this distinction that Robert Ballerun makes between harmonious and obsessive passion.

I mean, we're continuing working. You still work even when it's not paying off dividends and your personal life would have burnt out. It was when you just had burnout. But harmonious passion is so much healthier and has been correlated with well-being and Robert Ballerun has done so much research just showing that that pathway is much more sustainable route. Yeah.

And so, I mean, resiliency, like everybody defines it a little differently, right? So yes, I think it's a part of resiliency, but it's not the only thing. It's partly umbrella. Yeah. Yeah.

Because like, to be an Instagram influencer, you're kind of like having me constantly figure out what people want and giving it to them. Does that ever get like resentful? I don't know, I've never asked an influencer that before. But does that ever get a state where it's like, do you always see me for what I provide for you on Instagram? So I think I definitely feel a little bit of resentment towards the changing platforms. What's happening?",

I don't want people to be like, oh, I'm feeling X-thing. I don't trust myself. This is not real.

But my stuff was coming from other places. It was coming from needing to have my life look a certain away now that I moved to New York. And I was newly married.

If you grow up in poverty, unfortunately, that creates a lot of internalized shame because the world is telling you that you don't deserve things. So your question was about how to transform it into curiosity. And the first thing we need to do is we need to recognize what shame looks like for us. And I didn't know that. I didn't know what my shame looked like up until I was like in my early 30s and I was already a practicing therapist, right? Um, so shame is very insidious, like it's very hidden. So a way to understand how shame shows up for you is to genuinely reflect on the patterns in your relationships. Just think back to your last three relationships and see if there's like a pattern, did you feel the same way, even though all the other partners",

It doesn't mean that we didn't find it. Yeah, so I, if I understand your question correctly, it's how you, you're like, I mean, a lot of parapsychologists have had personal experience of this stuff.

So, you know, Ben did his studies that we spoke about earlier on. Since then, he's tried to replicate it quite rightly with two large scale replications that haven't worked. And so the evidence for that doesn't look so good. But that's what we have to fall back on. And the scientific method, particularly in psychology, isn't very accurate. You know, it's squishy.

And it's only really over time when you've got enough evidence collected on certain conditions, you can make certain conclusions, but it will take some time. Yeah, but I don't even know if there's anything you would find evidence-wise that would convince the believers, you know, there's- Yeah, I mean, that's true. That's what we said.

And that kind of makes sense because to make the paranormal attribution, you have to be quite open to something which isn't really so often widely believed in Western society at least. And second, you're often making a connection between two events. So if you have a dream and then the following day something happens, you have to see some kind of correspondence between that dream and what happened. And the more creative you are, the better ability to have to see those correspondences. So you might in your dream see, it makes something up, a ship coming in to pour.",

Like IQ tests have been studied, but is there an implicit intelligence that are some people generally better at unconscious pattern recognition and non-conscious pattern recognition? How's that correlate with IQ? So that was my cognition paper was showing a zero correlation between the two.

And some of them actually were much quicker at learning the reoccurring like very complex pattern. And that's just one example.

Well, the first one wasn't my best show to put it mildly, but you have to do 10 in a row. By the time you hit show 10, it was pretty tight. And I could sit at home imagining this wonderful show and how funny and hilarious it was going to be. It doesn't matter until you're out there doing it. That's what you learn. Such a deep truth.

I credit Howard Gardner as being one of the most important influences on my decision to go into the field of psychology. I was actually accepted to be his graduate student to be co-advised by him and the late Kurt Fisher, but ultimately I decided to study with Robert Sternberg for graduate school, who also has done groundbreaking work on human intelligence.

It's kind of sad, and if we talk to it, it makes me kind of sad about psychology in general, because I think it's much true narrow.

And of course, that's infinitely easier in the 21st century than it ever was before because through computers there are many, many different ways in which we can reach people. So that's individuation. pluralization is figure out what's important and teach it more than one way. And any good teacher has more arrows and is a herb quiver than just one way of teaching.

And certainly in human prehistory going back thousands of years, this determined whether you survived or not in the southern African areas where human beings started. But nowadays where we use naturalist intelligence is when we go to the grocery store or to a shopping center or go to go to Amazon and we try to decide which of two shoes to buy, which of two hairdryers to buy or which of two idols to buy, we're using the same brainwear that was developed",

And this is mentioned in the two books, The Essentials, if I were given another 10 or 20 years, I would love to be able to consider not just human intelligence, but animal plant and artificial, because I think that's the next frontier for say, psychology in the large sense.

We didn't have MRIs and there was no real no real way of investigating what was going on in the brain as we say in vivo. So now the question is almost the opposite.

Welcome to another episode of the Human Potential Lab, where I teach you the latest science of important psychological concepts that are relevant to your daily life. Today, I'm going to be teaching you about the intersection of personality, creativity, and well-being. These are all three things that are very interesting to people, and when you look at the integration of them, you can really get close to a life well-lived. So first off, I want to just do a little primer on what is personality? A lot of people think of personality as this thing that is ingrained, that doesn't change much throughout our lives, that you are either an extrovert, or you're an introvert. You are either highly",

Turns out the personality is actually something that is quite fluid and can be context dependent. It's partly determined by our genes, and it's also partly determined by the environment. But when we talk about personality, we're just talking about what psychology is called density distributions. So throughout the course of your day, you tend to score more introverted, let's say, in most of your actions, like a four or five on a five point scale. But you may have your moments where you're extremely extroverted. Maybe you get really inspired to stand on a table and dance. Who knows? You know what the context can bring out of a human. So I think it's important, first of all, to just say that personality is not something said in stone and",

Now, we can through a lot of intense effort try to change our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. And in doing so change, important parts of our personality, but we can also accept a lot of our patterns, of thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and embrace our personality. So it's only up to you to decide what you want to embrace and self-accept and what you want to change. And the good news is that you can change your personality.

They feel emotionally stable. They feel like they can reach their goals and move toward their goals even with internal disruptions, such as emotional upset, as well as external disruptions, like a traumatic episode that happens.

Actually, the science of cybernetic is actually the study of organic goal-directed systems. And that includes humans. And also includes other systems, other biological systems that are goal-oriented like us. But any goal-directed organism must have a certain degree of stability, as well as plasticity to fully thrive.

So to the extent to which you score higher on the extraversion polls, the extent to which you're less of an introvert. And then the more you score high to the left of the on the pole to the introversion side, the less you are an extrovert. And that's how modern day personality psychologist tend to think of it. The two main aspects of extroversion are enthusiasm and assertiveness. Let's look at some of the items and see how they're tested to see maybe where you score on these two.

And I think we all know who are the ones who are the extremes. They're kind of obvious even through like five seconds of talking to them.

Things like social status, power, social attention, positive social attention, networking events, risky sex, those sorts of things we'd call them primal rewards. Introverts, with the way their dopaminergic system functions, they tend to have to work a little bit harder to get energized for those things.

Even the most extroverted of the extrovert, while they're threshold for getting tired from socializing, maybe higher than the introvert, they still too at a certain point can get exhausted from too much socializing. So we're just talking about thresholds here, and dopamine plays an important role in that sense of whether or not you're feeling energized and wanting to put in the work towards something.

Within the agreeable disagreeableness domain, I'm really interested in the dark triad and it's counterpart, which my researchers and I came up with.

You can actually score high in the dark triad, also score somewhat on the light triad as well, or all sorts of different combinations, high on the light triad, and have a little dark triad.

And then in these sciences, when we talk of things like music, visual arts, creative writing, we talk about the various aspects of the arts, we found that IQ actually was not correlated with creative achievement in the arts, but what was correlated with the creative achievement in the arts above everything else was openness to experience, which really, as I've noted, involves a deep rich imagination as well as an openness to engaging in the full depth and breadth of your emotions.

But being consistent in your goals is not necessarily the most predictive thing of creativity, because creativity often involves a lot of trial and error. Creativity often involves having to shift goals, having to be flexible. Remember, talk about the stability personality trait at the beginning.

So I think I'm really intrigued about those situations when there's so many barriers to listening, but it's really important to maintain a relationship.

But it makes a big difference what your intention is because that will guide everything downstream. It will guide what you pay attention to, how you pay attention, how you respond to what the other person is saying.

Those are just very different conversations. Yeah, that's a really good point. And it just seems like our cultural climate right now is not one of listening. It feels like listening is a radical act in and of itself. Not not that you're talking about radical listening, but I think listening can be radical. Just in certain contexts.

One is the one you just talked about that highlighting the fact that listening itself can be an intervention. And it's not a solution to everything, but we see that listening can be used as the starting point for creating dialogue. So the idea of listening as a way of building connection. We think that's kind of a radical idea. The other aspects of what makes it radical is that we move beyond, you know, active listening. Scott, this idea that really active listening to us sounds that it's almost reactive listening. You know, it's it's lots of strategies to look like we're listening where with radical listening, we want to be equal partners in the conversation. We see radical listening as proactive.

So this is a form of listening where as the listener, you're a full participant, you're fully present, you're fully engaged, you're in there, not just like a sponge taking in information, which is sometimes how we think about listening, but really being an active participant. So that's why we call it radical listening. We keep going back to the idea that there are different intentions for listening. And I think that that hopefully feels fresh to people because listening is so often construed as sponging up or just taking in or just hearing. But if you sort of prepare yourself to say, I'm",

If you're listening to to connect with someone, you might be listening for shared interests or experiences or hobbies, things like that. So so knowing your intention right up front, it it directs your attention like a spotlight. So intention, intention leads to attention.

And that's where the skill of quieting, for example, comes in. And of course, it's the quiet in terms of the trying to prevent distractions and noise from interfering.

And I started thinking about all the times that people said to me things like, oh, Robert, I only have five minutes. Walk with me. Or come with me to my next meeting because I only got two minutes.

It's part of the preparation for having radical listening conversations. Is how do we find what it is we need, even prior to engaging with others? So there's something about meeting our own needs. And I see links to mindful practices and just looking after our own well-being. So there's something about making sure our own needs are met so that we can be fully present for others.

If I'm able to provide my full and undivided attention, that feels like a gift, but that does require understanding my inner game if you like. Then there's conversational quiet. And for me, Scott, this is about firstly slowing things down a little bit, maybe even in the way we speak and you were talking about cadence to bring a kind of a calm to the conversation.

That's what was going on. And I grew up in that environment where I think that's when I started realizing you have to listen well even as a survival mechanism.

When I was constructing my characteristics of self-actualization skill, I found the correlation was so high between self-acceptance and other acceptance that I had to collapse it as a single factor, which I just called acceptance, because I couldn't distinguish between the two.

It's a great question or way to delineate. Commentary. And I don't think we're suggesting that never the twinge will meet. There's going to be some overlap. But when we think internal, right, and there are things like quieting yourself, having an accepting attitude, we're juxtaposing that with the so-called external, but you can think of external the way we frame it is verbal. Then they're a little counterintuitive because they're aspects of listening that are actually talking. So interjecting, asking a question, acknowledging the other person are all parts of listening, but weirdly, you're speaking when you do it. So when we are talking about external, we are limiting ourselves specifically to instances in which the listener speaks as a form of listening. Could",

So I love the idea that in order to be accepting of others, one of the things we can be doing in the background is being more accepting of ourselves and like compassion, being compassionate of others. I think the same applies. We need to apply self-compassion. So there's a beautiful thing about in order to provide the kind of listening that you want to give to others.

Let's just say, this collection of cards, the Happiness Trap Cards is really all-encompassing. I mean, as I'm reading it, I'm like, wow, he's covering from self-esteem to thinking, thinking traps to living a life of gratitude. I mean, it's really, it's all mental life.

It sounds like it's like a tweet. Everything's a tweet. Yeah, yeah, I've never been onto the Twitter space. Well, I tell a lie, I was on it for about a month and then I gave up.

And the human mind often interprets things in a way that makes things even more stressful than they need to be. So when I use the term hooked, what it means is your thoughts and feelings are having a huge impact on you. They're jerking you around. They may pull your attention away from what's important, what's meaningful. So you're no longer focused on what you're doing, you're no longer engaged in what you're doing.

One of this approach is obviously very similar as well to Susan David's idea of emotional agility, right? Yeah, absolutely. Susan David uses acceptance and commitment therapy. She acknowledges it at the back of the book that she doesn't really mention it throughout the book, but yes, her book is absolutely based on the same approach.

It's about just kind of having a new way of interacting with them so they just lose their power. They become like water off a duck's back. They can't jerk you around. When did you get so interested in this approach? Well, it was started from a personal journey. I mean, I graduated as a junior doctor in my 20s and I was, you know, miserable. I was depressed. I was anxious. And I couldn't understand why. I mean, you know, being a doctor, everyone said that was going to make your life brilliant. You know, it's prestige, status, it's",

I started to become very interested in the psychological aspects of medicine and lose a much interest in the physical side. And so I was, I was working as a GP, family doctor in Melbourne, Australia. And I found that as a GP, my consultations with my patients were getting longer and longer and longer.

And each model I found some things that I liked and some things that I didn't like and some things that worked and other things that didn't work.

How would you describe the difference between Act and Collegiate Behavioral Therapy, particularly the new crop of it, the mindful Collegate Behavioral Therapy that my friend Seth Gillhand is kind of spearheading?

So just to continue this, sailboat metaphor and sea metaphor, how are urges like waves? Oh, yeah. Well, so an urge is like a wave in the sense that if you watch a wave, it rises, it reaches a peak or a crest, and then it falls again into a trough, and then it rises, the peak is some falls. And our emotions are like that. Our urges are like that. Even the most intense emotions, they will actually rise and reach a peak and then fall. Even when you're really",

Yes, yes, I've been thrown around by the waves before. And that's what you mean by surfing. You don't want to resist a wave, right? Because what happens if you do resist a wave? No, no. If you resist it, you get slammed. And so surfing a wave means you kind of ride it. And it's the same with our own urges, cravings and tense emotions. We can learn how to surf them, rather than in everyday language, particularly with urges, we talk about resisting urges, but resisting urges is much like resisting a wave.

And so people hold on to this idea and a link to that idea is the idea that if happiness is feeling good, that means I need to get rid of all the unpleasant feelings or the negative thoughts or the painful emotions, that's how I get to be happy.

I'm saying because I won't, you know, I don't attack other performers, you know, teaches on but I'll give my side of things because they're willing to give their side of things as well.

And you really have a lot of hope that that everyone can be can increase their attract. Everybody's attractive to somebody. If you're never meet a woman who's attracted to you, it's you're meeting the wrong women. So you can improve yourself to become attractive the more women, right?",

It's not an issue of like, oh, women just like tall guys with money are like, oh, women, you know, like all the bullshit that you can sell. I have this whole idea about that. But, but, but you do make a point, you can become genuinely, generally more attractive by doing certain things. You talk about appearance. You can increase your fashion and fitness. There's something we all can improve, no matter how your, how many eyes you have or noses you have. It's pretty simple. Like, it doesn't, it's not very hard. And",

How much they can up level themselves just by doing that. You say, women are attracted to a man they can respect to a man they can trust. If you're constantly looking for approval for what to say and how to feel, how could anyone respect or trust you? And so I think a lot of this, you know, it just keeps coming back to that.

And then we get to where, I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, right? Even Reagan, you know, was president in the 80s. And so I think it's increasingly become about, you know, who you trust. What kind of personality, you know, talk about personality, what kind of personality do you trust to kind of protect you and your interests? And I think the rise of populism recently has been really about like, let's put our faith in in strong personalities who,",

And so maybe this is a little more kind of like in the science than is in the book. But we have a kind of template in our mind. So here's an example of a template. Let's say, I say like, what's it like to go to a restaurant? And then your template is like, well, I sit down and someone comes and takes my order and then brings me food, right?

And what we find is that Conservatives, we're talking like committed conservatives, seven out of seven on a conservative scale, they think that all people are around about equally vulnerable to suffering. So whether you're white or black, whether you're an immigrant or a citizen, whether you're a Muslim or Christian, you're roughly the same.

And then folks that belong to groups that are maybe you could argue are less marginalized, right? Especially in progressive circles. Those billionaires, yeah, billionaires exactly cops, right? Progressive see those folks as basically almost impervious to harm.

He argues that people with OCD have a unique temperament, which includes heightened existential sensitivity and a richer imagination. While people with OCD certainly have their struggles and tend to be obsessed about causing harm or receiving harm, Michael also points us to all the ways that OCD have historically been channeled into some of the greatest works of art and literature and how everyone with OCD can have a healthier relationship with their OCD.

Yeah, and I think you brought up a good point that everywhere in psychology and the history of psychotherapy, we find something and then we feel like we're missing something.

Right, you have these obsessions, you have these compulsions, right, that that's it. Yeah. But I actually see it from a completely different framework, which is sort of similar to how Susan Cain looks at introverts. People with OCD have a unique temperament and sensibility of sensitivity, an empathic sensitivity. There's research out of Germany that shows that people with OCD are more empathically tuned in. Wow. Then not only healthy controls, but people with other garden varieties, I guess. Is there a correlation between OCD diagnosis and",

So if you're empathic and you notice how people feel and what their experience is, if you're intuitively tuned into them, you also notice when they get hurt. You also notice when there's ruptures, this is what makes us good therapists. That's why actually there's a lot of therapists I think who do have OCD tendencies because it actually makes us really good at noticing. We have a sixth sense of empathy and intuition.

I didn't know Charles Darwin had OCD. He worried that his children would die. He was concerned about reassurance. There's a story of him in the middle of the night going to his friend's house to make sure he didn't offend him. He struggled a lot of these things that we would consider classic OCD symptoms.

But I do think one of the things that's really fascinating about OCD is that it's very much nature and nurture. There's certainly a biological component to the fact of having a tendency to spiral, to ruminate, but also to be empathically tuned in. That's where I think that what gets missing and current ideas about OCD is not looking at... I call people with OCD they have extraordinarily generous heart.

So the lack of self-compassion and self-abvocacy for a person with OCD is extraordinarily interesting. So my take on it is, how do we harness the beauty of that big heart but also turn it towards the self? There's a great poem by Derek Walcott, Love After Love, one of Obama's favorite poems. He says, the time will come with a lation when you will greet yourself in your own mirror. Sit, feast on your own life. Give back the love you've given to another.

And I started to think about my mom, who passed away several many years back, and didn't get to meet my son. And I was feeling both the wistfulness of my mom, my mom prized my playing as a pianist. She encouraged it. And then I was thinking how I missed my mom being able to meet my child, my son, and my son without missing a beat, he was about three. So Dadda, why are you sad? Now he could pick up with that emotional sensitivity. He could tune into it. Do you think he has OCD times? I think he has the sensitivity part of it. Wow. Because he misses nothing. I mean, his preschool teacher said, Aiden is lovely. He's smart, he's cute, but nothing",

And exactly what you're saying is that I do think that people with OCD are keen to be friendly, aware of the existential givens. And that's what I think is the beauty is that. So I joking in the book that OCD is like playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon. Yeah, I was going to ask you that. And Kevin Bacon is the death. But if you can focus, if you can actually face death as Yolum talks about, then you're really living and making meaning out of life. Yes. Well, how do you think Kevin Bacon would feel that you likened him to Dadda at the core? Yeah. I think he's been successful and still looks young enough to not really get to bother by it. I consider him a mosh, Kevin. I mean, really, you know,",

Because if you think about it, I'm going to, I'm going to rationalize this one because if you think about it, when I'm talking about the Kevin Bacon, actually, when you're talking about death, you're actually really talking about life, right? So fear of death is really the fear of not being fully alive. It's completely, that's it. And that's what so poetry, like I was once taught, is both about love and loss. Yeah. It's about the line ending, but what we do with the breaks. And it's about kind of being in that contradiction. So I really see Kevin Bacon. I really see it's about life by facing death. Exactly what Yolum would say. Like, Yolum doesn't write about existentialism being like, oh my gosh, like I'm a morbid goth. Did he wrote a whole book on the importance of facing death? Yeah.

Because he's going to listen to this. He's also a great musician too, by the way. I mean, yeah. Don't let's not flatter Kevin Bacon too much. I mean, yeah, that's true. He don't want to his ego to add a control. Let's end this interview today with a point you made in your book. Edith Essence, what you did in your book is you drilled down to the core of OCD, which you conceptualize as a profound and precocious existential awareness that sensitizes you, not only to loss, but also to the fragile beauty of life itself. You also explored how being in touch with these questions in a creative way with proper support could make it possible to",

So I just want to thank you so much for stripping some of that terrifying nature of it and expanding our views of OCD. You've helped me personally in reading this book. I want to send a copy of this book to my mom and to anyone I know who has OCD and really humanize this in a really important way. And this was also my first time ever coming out as having OCD. So I thought it was a big, good place to do that. Welcome to the club. It's a good club to be a part of. Yeah. So thank you so much, Michael. I'm really so deeply appreciative of you being here.
