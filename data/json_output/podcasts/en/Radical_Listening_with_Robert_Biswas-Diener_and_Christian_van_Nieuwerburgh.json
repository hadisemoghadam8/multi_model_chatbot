It's part of the preparation for having radical listening conversations is how do we find what it is we need, even prior to engaging with others. So there's something about meeting our own needs. I see links to mindful practices and just looking after our own well-being. So there's something about making sure our own needs are met so that we can be fully present for others. Today we have Robert Biswa Steiner and Christian Van Nureberg on the Psychology Podcast. Together they are authors of the new book Radical Listening, the Art of True Connection.

You know, one of the reasons this book came about, as Scott is because Robert and I have wanted to work together on a project right before, well, actually during the pandemic, we found that we weren't meeting up as we were regularly at conferences and things. And we were looking for some kind of joint project. And we started doing some online training and out of that, we started gathering insights about listening.

We were just talking about interaction styles, conversation, acknowledging people, politeness, or just everything about communication. And it sort of emerged out of that and it took us by surprise. Oh, I love that. Well, before we double click on all the things that took you guys by surprise, let's back up a second and can you introduce yourselves to our audience a little bit?

I'm Christian Vanjurberg. I'm an academic and author and executive coach. And I think the thing that's been driving me is real curiosity, Scott. I've just been curious right from the outset.

And Robert, you are, I guess the founder of Positive Psychology Coaching. Would you say you're one of the founders of that field of the entire field? Can you try to talk a little bit about what is Positive Psychology Coaching? I would definitely say I'm among the pioneers. I don't know if I would take full credit for lifting the entire field.

And what if you want to show up in a positive way and you also are having a debate with someone, let's say you're showing up and this is the outside of coaching context for a second. But just like if you're having a conversation with an uncle who was a very different political view from you, how can you still show up in a positive way and still be assertive in your own value system?

And one of the barriers to listening, of course, is wanting to prove that we're right.

And if the purpose is to build connection, if our intention is to build connection, that'll help us to think about what are the best ways of listening. So I think I'm really intrigued about those situations when there's so many barriers to listening, but it's really important to maintain a relationship. And that's when I think some of the ideas in our book Radical Listening play a part. I think Christian just said something really important, which is",

Sometimes the intention is to validate the other person. Sometimes it's to connect with the other person. But it makes a big difference what your intention is because that will guide everything downstream. It will guide what you pay attention to, how you pay attention, how you respond to what the other person is saying.

Those are just very different conversations. Yeah, that's a really good point. And it just seems like our cultural climate right now is not one of listening. It feels like listening is a radical act in and of itself. Not not that you're talking about radical listening, but I think listening can be radical. Just in certain contexts. But you do use the phrase radical listening. Can you just explain a little about like the what is the construct radical listening? How's it differ from just normal everyday listening?

One is the one you just talked about that highlighting the fact that listening itself can be an intervention. And it's not a solution to everything, but we see that listening can be used as the starting point for creating dialogue. So the idea of listening as a way of building connection. We think that's kind of a radical idea. The other aspects of what makes it radical is that we move beyond, you know, active listening. Scott, this idea that really active listening to us sounds that it's almost reactive listening. You know, it's it's lots of strategies to look like we're listening where with radical listening, we want to be equal partners in the conversation. We see radical listening as proactive. So for example, the thinking of",

So this is a form of listening where as the listener, you're a full participant, you're fully present, you're fully engaged, you're in there, not just like a sponge taking in information, which is sometimes how we think about listening, but really being an active participant. So that's why we call it radical listening. We keep going back to the idea that there are different intentions for listening. And I think that that hopefully feels fresh to people because listening is so often construed as sponging up or just taking in or just hearing. But if you sort of prepare yourself to say, I'm",

So when you listen to validate someone, you're paying more attention and placing greater weight on emotional expression, on posture, on words, whereas if you're listening to solve a problem, you're probably listening for procedures, key components, things like that. If you're listening to to connect with someone, you might be listening for shared interests or experiences or hobbies, things like that. So so knowing your intention right up front, it it directs your attention like a spotlight. So intention, intention leads to attention. And you think you're just paying attention to everything, but you're not. You're just taking a specific slice out, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. Yeah, that's so well put.

And that's where the skill of quieting, for example, comes in. And of course, it's the quiet in terms of the trying to prevent distractions and noise from interfering. But we also think about how the listener needs to be able to quiet what's going on internally for them as well to create the space where we're really present for the other person.

It's almost like a gateway to dialogue. And you're right that the dialogue is something that, you know, I think a lot of us are yearning for more opportunities for dialogue.

It's part of the preparation for having radical listening conversations. Is how do we find what it is we need, even prior to engaging with others? So there's something about meeting our own needs. And I see links to mindful practices and just looking after our own well-being. So there's something about making sure our own needs are met so that we can be fully present for others.

If I'm able to provide my full and undivided attention, that feels like a gift, but that does require understanding my inner game if you like. Then there's conversational quiet. And for me, Scott, this is about firstly slowing things down a little bit, maybe even in the way we speak and you were talking about cadence to bring a kind of a calm to the conversation.

There's one aspect that is self compassion saying, well, even if I slip up and I'm really not the best listener in this moment, I'm going to give myself some love because I have so much on my mind, right?

But actually meeting them is being like, hey, it looks like your your mind is really elsewhere right now. Let me join you where you are. I feel it can be a radical listening skill. Absolutely.

I'd had emails that I didn't like. And my son comes in, I open the door and I'm like, hey, how is school today? But half listening because I'm thinking I need to get back to my emails with that other thing going on. And I think he said, I was playing a sport and I fell down and hurt myself.

But the half listening is, wait, I thought they were listening to me and they kind of let me down here. So that's just something where I think some of the ideas of radical listening, I mean, we wrote this book thinking of a professional audience at some of the time, but it's a lot of it applies in our, maybe in our closest relationships as well.

And I'm curious what you've learned about the listening process just in doing this. Well, a lot of things I've learned really do dovetail with the things you talk about in your book. You know, the questioning, the being, you know, being careful, like when you're interjecting, the art of interjecting, right? Like there is an art to it.

So it's just so intuitive now after 10 years. It's not like I started off with that internalized, but I'm saying you talk to enough people. You realize that conversations have a certain, have different cadences to them. Some which are more facilitative and to to connection and to a real conversation. Some more conducive, some more jerky.

But it seems gendered these days for some reason. People, babies. Yeah. Yeah. I have a big interest in education. I think that's why I got into coaching in the first place.

If we want our learners to have that kind of rich experience where people see things in them that they don't see that people are valued for their strengths rather than their weaknesses, my challenging comment is that has to be the same right throughout the educational system.

I'm a big fan of the idea of teaching psychological and social skills, teaching emotional literacy, but just teaching conversational skills. If you think about for most people the amount of time you spent studying trigonometry, geometry calculus or other higher forms of math relative to how much you use that math in your daily life versus how much time you spent studying listening compared with how much you actually listen in your daily life.
