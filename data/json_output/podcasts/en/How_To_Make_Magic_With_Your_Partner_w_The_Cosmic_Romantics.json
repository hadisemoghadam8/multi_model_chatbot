I grew up in the Chicago area, and in college, all I cared about and did was improv and sketch. I mostly did not pay attention to classes. And then after college, moved Chicago with some of my friends and spent three years there. I don't know exactly what I was trying to do. I guess get on a senile or something.

Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. There doesn't need to be a financial kind of reason behind it. I think I got into improv in the first place. Well, I saw a show at Second City in Chicago when I was a kid, and I thought that was amazing. And I was like, well, I want to do that.

I mean, I still get a little scared performing, but probably much less than most other people. Wait, I'm going to pivot a second to both of you. Were you both oddballs in elementary school? Oh, yeah.

And so I felt really, I was also socially awkward because we were never really in one place for a long time. So I would get anxiety going to school. I would cry, you know, before going to school because I felt like I didn't have any friends. But I always felt more myself on stage ever since I was three years old.

I didn't know there was a community. So I just stuck with music and dance. And then it wasn't until I was 24 when I came to the magic castle for the first time.
