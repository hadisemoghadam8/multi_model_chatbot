Well, you're a lifelong entertainer. So I want to start there a little bit to your childhood because you were a street performer when you were like 12? No, a little bit older than that. I got into magic when I was probably eight or nine, something like that and via my grandfather who showed me a very good magic trick. He only knew one magic trick, but it was a very good one.

And they are sizable, you know, in terms of confidence, in terms of problem solving, getting a can-do attitude and so on. So I got into magic, got into a local magic club, and then went to study psychology because of magic. Actually, I read a book that I said, as handy as magicians are likable. And so therefore you should read how to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie, which is an amazing book. I mean, it's dated now, but it's incredible.

And so in my sort of summer breaks, I would go and do street entertaining down there. I guess they're in my sort of early teens. And I was pretty awful. I was pretty bad at it. It's a hard way of making a living because people can walk off, you know, if they don't like what you're doing, they just they wander off.

I've just seen this poster for a PhD position, which would be perfect for you studying the psychology of magic up in Edinburgh.

Up here is Professor Robert Morris, who was the Curse, a professor of parapsychology. So Bob was, I don't know, he believed in paranormal stuff or not. He certainly very open to it. But he also knew that lots of the psychics and mediums and so on were cheats. And he wanted someone to do some work on psychology magic. So he could sort of separate the two out.

So it sent me in a good kind of stead for that. So yeah, it was Bob Morris up here. And that was for glorious years doing psychology of magic stuff. That's so cool. I feel like the psychology of the paranormal is a very fringe area of psychology. When I go to the APA conferences, I just don't meet many paranormal psychologists. That's definitely true.

Well, let's say someone actually replicates, well then it's like, wait a minute, hold on, maybe we should now focus on this. Yeah, no, that's true. It has the opportunity or the possibility of revolutionizing exactly how we see the mind and so on. But you do need evidence, good evidence.

And he did some, some great work on that quite early work. And then one of my books was about entirely about self-perception theory, the ripet up book called The As If Principle and States.

And that kind of makes sense because to make the paranormal attribution, you have to be quite open to something which isn't really so often widely believed in Western society at least. And second, you're often making a connection between two events. So if you have a dream and then the following day something happens, you have to see some kind of correspondence between that dream and what happened.

So I think that's the challenge from magicians. It's actually to remain likable. What's doing this weird activity, essentially lying to people? Yeah, I think being likable is like half the battle of being a good magician, especially if you do walk around, you know, and getting people receptive to even just, I think more, more than half the battle. Yeah. Getting people into that state of mind, but they don't care in a good way how the trick is done is, is absolutely key to it. You know, magicians are entertainers. Well, and it's difficult. I don't know. What are you thoughts? What do you think of mentalism? I'm obsessed. I love mentalism. And I, and just personally,",
