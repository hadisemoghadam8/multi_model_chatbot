I wanted to bring this what I do in the clinical work, what I've done in my own life, and also sort of homage to my mom to say, look, there's so much more within this. And that's what I mean.

In this episode, we have a refreshing humanistic discussion about obsessive compulsive disorder. Michael is critical of the standard medical model of OCD and points out the upsides of OCD. He argues that people with OCD have a unique temperament, which includes heightened existential sensitivity and a richer imagination. While people with OCD certainly have their struggles and tend to be obsessed about causing harm or receiving harm, Michael also points us to all the ways that OCD have historically been channeled into some of the greatest works of art and literature and how everyone with OCD can have a healthier relationship with their OCD. So without further ado, I bring you Michael Alcy. Michael Alcy, how are you? So good to see you. Yeah, I've been really",

Yeah, I think it's funny thing. The humanist thing is so interesting because creativity is the centrality I think of being human and being able to be with the contradiction and complexity and nuance, the messiness of it. Yeah. But also the transcendence of it. They kind of go together, which I think is the brilliant part. Leonard Cohen said, if you don't become the ocean, you'll be seasick every day.

And, you know, the Renaissance Da Vinci. And all of this stuff I think that brings it in. And I think you're right. I think one of the things that's really exciting about where psychology is right now is a field, is that we're embracing more of the feeling poetic side, as well as the logical linear side. Yeah.

Oh, yeah. So the square is the logic and the circle is the notion. Yeah. It's the poetic and the linear. And from my money, like the humanistic is about embracing the contradictions and complexities of that. Well, on that backdrop, let's talk about OCD. Yeah.

Yeah. Not replace, you know, but give them more expansive view of who they are and what they're capable of. So really congratulations on this amazing book.

All these things that kind of you ruminate on in a way that you sort of can't stop even though you'd like to. And the compulsion part of it is the side, well, I want to do something to feel more in control and to suit the anxiety around this nagging obsession. So I'm going to wash my hands. I'm going to cancel the thoughts with a mantra or a prayer. I'm going to try to do something that purges me of this nagging feeling. And so obsessions and compulsions go hand in hand.

So let's really discuss what it's like to have OCD and really get into that. Yeah, and I think you brought up a good point that everywhere in psychology and the history of psychotherapy, we find something and then we feel like we're missing something.

And he says, there's something about incremental innovation and then there's recombinant innovation, which is when you pull from different areas. So the thing that I'm not so pleased with with where OCD is currently is that it's looked at like in this kind of linear literal way. Right, you have these obsessions, you have these compulsions, right, that that's it. Yeah. But I actually see it from a completely different framework, which is sort of similar to how Susan Cain looks at introverts. People with OCD have a unique temperament and sensibility of sensitivity, an empathic sensitivity. There's research out of Germany that shows that people with OCD are more empathically tuned in. Wow. Then not only healthy controls, but people with other garden varieties, I guess. Is there a correlation between OCD diagnosis and",

Fascinating. Yeah. And so the other part of the temperament like we were joking about before we got on here is that there's an existential sensitivity. So if you're empathic and you notice how people feel and what their experience is, if you're intuitively tuned into them, you also notice when they get hurt. You also notice when there's ruptures, this is what makes us good therapists. That's why actually there's a lot of therapists I think who do have OCD tendencies because it actually makes us really good at noticing. We have a sixth sense of empathy and intuition.

They go into what if spiral, thoughts spirals and rabbit holes, but if you actually look at the mind, it's not too different from the obsessional aspect of creativity. And it's no surprise that Charles Darwin struck with OCD because if you think of the brilliance with which he looked at different angles of things and went down all sorts of different places, there's a connection. I didn't know Charles Darwin had OCD. He worried that his children would die. He was concerned about reassurance. There's a story of him in the middle of the night going to his friend's house to make sure he didn't offend him. He struggled a lot of these things that we would consider classic OCD symptoms.

They look at the Codate nucleus and they look at areas and try to see what kind of activity is going on in there. And I think still that jury is out on exactly. But I do think one of the things that's really fascinating about OCD is that it's very much nature and nurture. There's certainly a biological component to the fact of having a tendency to spiral, to ruminate, but also to be empathically tuned in. That's where I think that what gets missing and current ideas about OCD is not looking at... I call people with OCD they have extraordinarily generous heart. You know how the Grinch had a heart tenth size is too small?",

The person with OCD is probably most of the most scrupulous member of society, though they treat themselves as if they are a mass murderer. That's so interesting. So the lack of self-compassion and self-abvocacy for a person with OCD is extraordinarily interesting. So my take on it is, how do we harness the beauty of that big heart but also turn it towards the self? There's a great poem by Derek Walcott, Love After Love, one of Obama's favorite poems. He says, the time will come with a lation when you will greet yourself in your own mirror. Sit, feast on your own life. Give back the love you've given to another.

So Solomon-Ash for those who don't remember, he was at Swarthmore College and he did this famous social psychology experiment where he's trying to figure out it was supposedly a vision test, which is the correct line that corresponds to this one. And of course, he had all these confederates. I'd be like, oh hell no. Yeah, I'd be like, what? Oh, it's.

And it's very clear that you're trying to restore the humanity to OCD. And, I'm not going to say but, but end, because your book is all about both end. And, as your whole book is about both end, I will say that for those who are in the grips of OCD, all this is very cold comfort. Yes.
