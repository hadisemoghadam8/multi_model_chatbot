Well, I mean, the most out there idea, which is one that actually a lot of scientists have come to, is the idea that consciousness does not, it's not confined to the, you know, the cranium. And what's interesting is that if you ask these children, they will tell you that they have the hard time staying in their body. So they spend a lot of time in a disassociative state. Today we have Dr. Diane Hennessy-Powl on the podcast. Dr. Powell is an integrative medical doctor, neuropsychiatrist, and psychotherapist. Her research interests include the neuroscience of extraordinary states of human consciousness, and anomalous experiences. Her book is called The ESP Enigma, the scientific case for psychic phenomena. Dr. Powell is an expert on autism and savant syndrome and has studied children who seem to actually be able to read minds.",

I really enjoyed this conversation. I am very interested in studying autistic savantes and I hope to do some testing myself. I found that Dr. Powell is a fellow open skeptic, which was great. Also, I love the question that is featured on her website. What is the full human potential? I really resonated with that question. So that further ado, I bring you Dr. Diane Hennessy-Powl.

And then afterwards, they're able to do either musical or mathematical tasks that they weren't able to do before. And so when you hear those kind of accounts, it makes it really compelling case for there being more to us than we think. Yeah, I'm waiting for that.

And I'd ask them, what's helping you? They're like, oh, you know that conversation we had about this or that. And I'd say, oh, OK. So you do what works.

Do you see a common thread running through Buddhism, Native American spirituality, and Egyptian hero graphics that you think says something about humans? I would say what I'd say is that if you look at a lot of these spiritual traditions, what you see is that the reality that they describe is very similar to the reality that is described by modern physics, quantum physics, and theory of relativity. And so there are several people like Fritz Gapra who've written about that. And so that's one of the things that's interesting. But also, I was really interested in what are the universal truths.

So one of the people I've been working with is somebody who's working off of these archives that come from interviews that an anthropologist did with indigenous elders over 100 years ago. Wow. And so they were meticulously transcribed and translated. And in it, there's a lot of science in it. That's what's so interesting. I mean, they had such a knowledge of, for example, the planets and how they and the star systems. And they really understood the cycles of nature.

But there's actually these cycles where certain trees are associated with certain planets. And you can predict when they're going to bud based on that. Correlation or causation? Well, it's an interesting thing. Because I mean, it's really hard to think of what the causative factor would be unless you're thinking that it has something to do with electromagnetism and the fact that we live in an ionized world.

And when did you first make contact with the phenomena of telepathy? That's how you say that word telepathy. Well, I guess you'd have to define what was in my first contact. And what I mean by that is that when I was a teenager, I had a friend who traveled with the circus with a magician. And one day that magician was in town.

But I think looking back on it, I think that that was really very akin to the love of the day. And so then the next time was when I was at Harvard. And I did consult on this patient who was trying to sign out against medical advice and staff thought that she was mentally ill and therefore incapable of making that decision for herself. And within minutes of meeting her, she started telling me things about myself that there was just no way that she could know. And",

Then the second thing she said to me is he's applying for a job right now in two different cities, which was right. There were two cities that he was applying for a post-doctorate in. And then I said, wow, that's really interesting. I said, can you tell me which cities? And she says, well, in his heart of hearts, he wants to go to one city, but you'll end up in the other one.

And I said, well, I said, well, where are we going to end up? And she said, well, name a bunch of cities. And I'll tell you which one. And so I named off maybe 10 cities. And then she said, San Diego, that's where you end up. And then she made other predictions about my life, all of which became true.

And so that's how I became interested in that. I think there is a really interesting question about, there are so many interesting questions. One is how much of what we're seeing is not fake. That's one big question, right? And another question is if it's not fake, what is the explanation? Is there a metaphysical explanation, or is there subtle cues sort of explanation that they don't even",

So I think there's like two interesting questions. I get the sense that the autistic individuals that you have been firsthand with, I get the sense that you don't believe they're faking it, you don't believe that they're like, they're like mentalists, you know, like magicians. Yeah, no, no, I don't know at all. They're just doing it, they're just doing it. Yeah, yeah, and, right, I mean, and you know, I have several reasons why I believe that.

And it has been people who are parents or teachers or speech therapists who work with these children. And something happens where the child types something or points on the letter board. And it is a repetition of what the person themselves is thinking. And or sometimes it starts with the child doing something like that's in response to whatever the person was thinking.

But, tell us what you would, I would be. Oh, what I would like to see is the two individuals that are telepathic with one another in separate rooms. And, and it's been hard to achieve with the, the children who are telepathic with their communication partner. Because, and so then I've wanted to study children that have more than one person they're telepathic with. And so, you know, or have more than one facilitator for their communication.",

And, and, and I think, I, the reason why I think it's possible that that could happen is, in part because of the fact that I looked in the literature and, and they're actually were these studies that were done back, you know, back before autism was even a diagnosis with these children that when you read the description of them, you'd say, oh, if that child was alive today, they, for sure that child would be diagnosed as autistic.

I don't know if you're aware of that, but he was working, there was a professor there. He really admired who told him about this study that was done by a friend of his who was an ophthalmologist. And the ophthalmologist had this child who was blind, but if the mother was in the room, the child could read the eye chart. And then he discovered that it was because he was really, you know, reading the child's mind.

And my friend who studies prodigies found that usually there is some family member who had this talent if you go far enough back. And so you start to think about genetic transmission. You start to think about, well, what's encoded in the genes? And then what exactly does that code for that allows for some exceptional talents? And then I start to think about telepathy. What's the genetics of the talent for telepathy? Yeah, well, it's very interesting. I mean, I come from a family of pattern recognizers. I mean,",

I mean, everybody's a mathematician or musician. I mean, my brother is a theoretical physicist and a brilliant mathematician. My father was a brilliant mathematician and scientist. And my mother was a brilliant musician. And I took a musician on both sides of the family. I got mathematicians on both sides of the family. And so there's something about in our genetics that predisposes us towards that pattern recognition as opposed to being verbal thinkers. And the problem is that most people are verbal thinkers. And verbal thinking can then get you caught up in these endless do loops. And you can",

So there's a real talent there for pattern recognition that probably a lot of these Autistic Savans have. By the way, Doud Trapper didn't like using the phrase Autistic Savan. He just wanted to call them Savans. So I don't know if we should do that. But yeah, no. So there's something. So I think without a doubt, pattern recognition plays a role.
