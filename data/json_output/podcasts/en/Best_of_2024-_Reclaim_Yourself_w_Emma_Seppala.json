I've known Emma since grad school, and she consistently puts out good vibes and teaches us how to have healthy bodies and minds. In this episode we discuss what Emma refers to as sovereign, which is designed to emancipate you from the many ways in which you knowingly or unknowingly subjugate yourself at every level of your existence, from yourself to your emotions, to your mind, to your relationships, to your intuition, and to your body. Emma shows us how we bind ourselves and how we can reclaim our sovereignty. Emma is a very wise and compassionate human and I think you'll learn stuff in this episode. You can apply",

Well, I think a lot of people are really yearning for that right now. So, you know, this major theme of this new book is setting yourself free and it's opposite state which you refer to as the bound state where through life experiences, fear and trauma, we start to disconnect from ourselves.

I mean, there's so many places to start in this discussion, but I see that word interwoven quite a bit throughout the book. Can you just kind of tell me what you think of that word? I love that as a first question, Scotty. Thank you. Because in many ways, as I'm contrasting the bound state and the sovereign state, the bound state is really everything that drains us of our energy.

And when we're in a sovereign state, that's the opposite. We're filling our own tank, we're maintaining it, but we're also filling others tanks. So, it's a pattern that goes through all of the different chapters. As one example, just as one belief that drains us is whenever I've asked audiences, how many people are a self-critical? Almost every single person raises their hand. And as you know, self-criticism, the psychological definition is that it's a form of self-loathing. And when you think about that, just at the majority of people are walking around with this, you could think of it as social conditioning or programming, like viral programming that runs in families and runs in societies and does us",

How do we get bounded and disconnected from ourselves and throughout the course of our lives, can our relationship with ourselves change depending on life circumstances? Absolutely. And I think that's the journey, right? That's the journey of, and it starts with awareness. Like being aware of the many ways that we engage with behaviors or thought patterns that drain our energy. Another example is our emotions. And I know you think about this a lot too. And that most people, when you ask, well, what have you learned about what to do with your emotions, your big, bad negative ones, people will say, well, just suppress them, right? Just suck it up, buttercup. That's pretty much what everyone is up to. I mean, there's some exceptions, you know, in some Latin cultures and southern Italy, but even then,",

And it's more likely to come out somatically, you know, through health stuff or it's going to explode or come out as passive aggression and destroying both ourselves and others in the process. So that's just sort of one example of that and how the journey towards becoming more sovereign with regards to our emotions is to learn to actually feel them. Just like a child will feel their emotions 100% and then it moves through them just like so going back to that theme of energy. The child lets the energy of the emotion move through them and then they're done a few minutes later as opposed to adults who can hold on to an emotion forever. Not to say that I'm encouraging",

When you ask people that they usually say words like you're such an idiot, you know, belong here not good enough, those kinds of words.

You know, we talk about toxic being in a toxic relationship or toxic workplace. Most people are walking around with a toxic relationship with their own self. What about that makes sense?

Yeah, you got me thinking that I think I might start using the phrase, instead of self-esteem, but we really need a healthy self-relationship. I like, yeah, just thought of that phrase, self-relationship, instead of self-esteem. Definitely. Totally. I mean, the only relationship you're guaranteed for the rest of your life is with yourself.

So fast forward, then, you know, did my doctoral program in psychology. And I was doing a postdoc and working with veterans with trauma. We're coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq. And many of them had gone through traditional therapeutic or pharmaceutical treatments. And they hadn't helped them. They were self-medicating, like in their basement, smoking weed or drinking, etc. And so I thought, you know, this helped me so many years ago. Let's see if we can help them with breathing.

And I think it does work, you know, being grateful and so forth. We know that that works. But when there is a really intense trauma, really intense anxiety, it's lodged in the body.

And that's why post-traumatic stress doesn't allow you to move on because it's as if that trauma is still right there in front of you right now where every time it's triggered, right? And so and they're not able to sleep for that reason. They're constantly in high activation. And what happens with the breathing we believe is that as they're going into this parisepathetic state and the memory may be coming up, there's like a decoupling that happens between the physiological activation and the memory. And so what they have said to us is I remember everything that happened, but I can move on. And they get off, got off their meds, their sleep meds, anxiety meds, you know,",
