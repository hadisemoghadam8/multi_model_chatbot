Dr. Morris is a professor of leadership at the Columbia Business School, and he also serves as a professor in the psychology department at Columbia. The topic of today's discussion is his new book, Tribal, how the cultural instincts that divide us can help bring us together. Dr. Morris has a bit of a different take on tribalism than the prominent narrative. He argues that human tribal instincts are not bugs in the system, but",

And you say tribalism is not necessarily a bad thing, because I do see everywhere these days. It's like toxic tribalism, right? Tribalism is ruined us all, and you kind of have a counter-intuitive approach to it.

And they correspond to what the evolutionist distinguish. And essentially, their instincts to imitate peers, to emulate heroes, and to perpetuate traditions. And so the first of these, the peer instinct, we can recognize that in us today, it's the, it's the sideways glances at our classmates, our co-workers, our neighbors, and the impulse to, match their behavior and mesh with them and be similar. And this meshing instinct gave us the gift of coordination. When a group can act as a united force, it's more efficient at foraging. It's more efficient at self-defense.

And work collectively to build a house that neither of us could build alone, that we know. And the important thing is not just that I know something and you know something, but I know that you know it. You know, so I can coordinate with you because I know that this is shared knowledge within our group. So that's the peer instinct.

Yeah, I'm really big in a transcendence. And universalism values, you know, the short, circumplex, I'm really into universalism values. And so I'm always trying to think of well, how can we transcend tribalism? So it was very interesting to read your book. And it- well, I love reading books like yours that make me think, that make me even rethink my own, you know, I don't have rigid anything. And ideas have been anything. And you know, I had really prior reading your book really been raw raw when you transcend tribalism. Yeah, I can see that because tribalism is usually associated with parochialism as an opposite of universalism. Right. And the whole spirit of universalism is let's leave",

And I think that, you know, we have to recognize that our deepest motivations and our deepest feelings of meaning come from thick identities, come from identities of people that we- that we interact with and that we know a lot about. And that- but that doesn't have to be parochial. The- when we think about cosmopolitanism, when we think about a city, this cosmopolitan, like New York or Paris, it is composed of neighborhoods that are very different from each other. And that is part of the magic of cosmopolitanism that I can- I can go to career town and then I can go a few steps and I'm in the East Village, you know, and it's a very different",

But there is a spirit of curiosity and mutual learning between the groups and that's what cosmopolitanism is. So cosmopolitanism is not the absence of tribalism. It's not the absence of- it's not people shedding tradition. It's- it's a selective retention of tradition combined with curiosity and openness. There's a form of universalism like, you know, Esperanto- you know, the Esperanto movement in the mid-20th century. They invented an artificial language that had sort of the least common denominator of all the languages of the world. And they said, we really need to get beyond this tower of babble of people speaking different languages. We've invented the perfect language, Esperanto. It doesn't have any tradition of poetry and it doesn't have a tradition of, you know, family memories or anything. But it would be a lot",

Didn't happen. You know, we can't even use the metric system. I don't think we can go speak Esperanto. And so there is a kind of- you know, there's a kind of inefficiency and hanging on to things not all of which are adaptive. That is an inherent part of tradition. But I think that we shouldn't- we shouldn't be an enemy of tradition, you know, like, yeah, or like when Mao tried to have a cultural revolution to destroy all the olds, you know, that were holding society back. A lot of good things get thrown out with the bad things when you try to- when you try to throw away traditions. So- now you sound",

But many of these things that have been around for a long time serve institutional purposes that are not so obvious on the surface. So, you know, yeah, I just think we shouldn't approach tradition with a wrecking ball. You know, we should approach it with skepticism and humor, you know. Yeah. So last question I have for an interview. How should we rethink workplace discrimination in light of your ideas in the book? Are you right about that in the books? I do. I do.

And then there's a question about what's- what motive is driving this inequality? And there's often a presumption that the motive is hostility towards the outgroup that is trying to like, you know, I'm trying to keep the non-whites down. And that's why the non-whites have not moved up in an organization. And I think that that certainly used to be the case, you know, it was overt. But the best survey evidence we have, you know, from anonymous surveys, you know, suggests that outgroup hostility, racial animus is not dead, but it's a small- it's a fringe for most people. It's a small group of people. Yet the inequality is not going away. It's it's it's in many ways as present as it was a generation or two ago. So it's time",

And what I argue is is that the tribal motivation that maybe the biggest cause of it is in group love rather than out-room hate. We have impulsive, unconscious drives to be generous to people who are similar to us, you know, ethnically religiously. And that is something that reproduces inequality. And a lot of organizational procedures like hiring for cultural fit or building referral systems into recruiting, they've turbocharged this in group favoritism. So I would say that, you know, we, we we're looking at the problem wrong. You know, we put so much, you know, Google spends a billion dollars a year on these anti-biased workshops. And yet 2% of their technical employees are people of color. So it's obviously not working. And I think it's it's not really addressing the real",

So we need to take a really close look at our policies and the policies that are enabling in group favoritism because that's the mechanism for most of this discrimination inequality. Not the kind that makes everybody feel bad because you're you you feel falsely accused of being a racist. Right. Because most most of these people are not racist, you know. Isn't an implication of that that if we did manage to get rid of the inequalities and let's say even it went in the opposite direction where those who are concerned minorities are the majority now, wouldn't they, wouldn't the same thing recreate itself?
