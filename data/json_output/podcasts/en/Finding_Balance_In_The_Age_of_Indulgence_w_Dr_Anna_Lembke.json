To kick off our new season, it's a real pleasure to have Stanford psychiatrist and addiction expert, Dr. Anna Lemke on the show. Dr. Lemke's latest book, which is the main topic of discussion for today, is called Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence. This book is very timely. Dopamine is a transmitter that affects our motivation, exploration, and our pleasure. While dopamine is not the pleasure molecule necessarily, it is",

You had to know which berries were safe to eat and which weren't. You had to know where the lions den was.

Because it's just so interesting because from an evolutionary perspective, clearly we've had some things that have been more reoccurring and have been able to operate on evolutionary mechanisms more than other things. So for some reason, well, for that reason, things like sex, well, we didn't have money back then, but just what the whole concept of money, you know, and power are things that we, the things we call a pettative rewards seem to be more inherently dopamine inducing than intellectual stimulation.

Is that is that a fair statement that there are certain things that are just more captivating to our dopamine system because of our evolutionary systems? It is a great question. I think the answer is a little bit more nuanced, which is to say that anything that we experience as reinforcing releases dopamine in our brains reward pathway. Some of those things release dopamine directly like cocaine or methamphetamine. Some of those things work through a complex chemical cascade like alcohol, which works on our endogenous opioid system or endogenous GABA system.

If you have a tribe that needs to shepherd scarce resources in order to survive, you don't want everybody going for bison or everybody going for blueberries. You want folks to be attracted to different things so that collectively we have all the things that we need. So that's how I would think about that.

Whereas things that release dopamine that tend to be less addictive, are things that release less dopamine more slowly and often require more upfront effort to get them. Yes, thank you for that. And I think that it's worth mentioning explicitly that there's a basic consensus in the field that dopamine means more about wanting than liking.

And let me describe that a little bit because it really depends on time sequence. When we initially are exposed to a reinforcing substance or behavior, or let me just rephrase that, when we're exposed to a substance or behavior, initially, if it has what's called salience for us, what we mean by that is that it releases dopamine. So it is triggering our approach response. So it is related to pleasure or light. Or initially, the initial exposure. Yes. But with repeated exposure, our brain adapts and ultimately resets dopamine, not at baseline levels of dopamine firing, but below baseline in a chronic dopamine deficit state, which is the addicted brain. And then our seeking mechanism is propelled primarily by wanting and primarily, dopamine is then primarily",

I'd like to do it again. If that makes any sense. It makes tons of sense. And what I see quite often is not just pleasure, but I see hope. There's something about this. There's something about dopamine that has so much to do with expectations. And your hope for, I'm gonna use the word hope for a continual pleasure in the future, even if you're no longer receiving that pleasure. At a certain point. And so it's quite a paradox co-lock. Oh, isn't it, isn't it? I mean, because on the one hand, it's the thing that keeps us go. It's the thing that gets us out of bed in the morning. Yes. If we didn't have",

Or maybe you'd even, maybe never even served our growth because there's a different way of pleasure and meaning, right? Yeah. So it is a very paradoxical molecule. And what's sort of baffling about it is that we tend to have very good memory or recollection for initial exposure to pleasure and pain. And that encodes itself very deeply in our minds. And with addictive substances, when we get that initial pleasure or we solve that initial problem, because sometimes the way in is that it's a problem solver, right?

But with repeated use after it stops working, and then can even turn on us and do the opposite of what we're seeking, we tend to not encode that with the same kind of fidelity. And we have what's often referred to in the field as euphoric recall, where we're now just remembering those initial exposures, the early highs, and the rest of our sort of behavior is in the service of trying to recreate those initial highs, which can get us into a lot of trouble, because then we can't see clearly when it's no longer serving that purpose.

The state of being addicted is essentially the state of progressing toward a lower level of dopamine firing. Really looks very much like a clinical depression. So in other words, some of us come into the world with a lower baseline dopamine level. Some of us acquire a lower baseline dopamine levels because of exposing our brains to these high rewards over time. And then there are other forms of psychopathology characterized by abnormalities in dopamine levels. Yeah, I was thinking Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a good one, but interestingly, Parkinson's disease is characterized by below normal levels of dopamine in a different part of the brain called the substantiinaigra, not in the reward pathway itself, which gets very complicated in terms of the",

So about a quarter of folks who get dopamine precursors to treat their Parkinson's will actually end up with a compulsive shopping disorder or a compulsive sex pornography and masturbation disorder. And these disorders tend to be dose dependent. So when the dopamine precursors stopped, the symptoms not in all cases, but",

Where dopamine sends its projections. And I think one of the projection roots that a lot of that's not as often discussed as the one to the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, right? It's not all being sent to the striatum. Right. So in that sense, as a cognitive scientist, by the way, who studied intelligence and working memory, I don't think we realize the extent to which dopamine also plays a role in our working memory and how some people have genes. I mean, we can really nerd out here, DRD, for there are certain genes that for certain individuals from an individual difference perspective, too much dopamine influx in the prefrontal cortex and cause them to have reduced working memory capacity.",

But what I do know is that there are studies showing that people with ADHD may indeed come into this world with a lower baseline level of dopamine firing, which means that they're relatively insensay to rewards, which means that they need more potent rewards, a priori, to get any kind of reward response at all, which may go some way into explaining the kind of impulsivity that's often associated with ADHD, impulsivity being difficulty, putting the breaks between a thought or desire to do something and actually doing it.

Yeah, even what we characterize as mental illness, the sort of auditory or visual experiences that people with schizophrenia have, we think of that as a form of psychopathology.

But with losing, recreational gamblers did not have an increase in dopamine, but pathological gamblers had an increase in dopamine firing even when losing, which maps very nicely onto the phenomenology or the subjective experience of pathological gamblers who will often report what's called loss chasing, where they actually want to lose because losing justifies in their minds staying longer gambling or staying in the game longer, which is essentially what they want.

And once they obtain that person, their interest disappears and they're on to the next person. We also see people clinically who are in addictive relationships, not even around sex, but just around the relationship itself. Most often, these just happen to be women, more often than men, who are often connected or pursuing or in relationship with a man with more of a narcissistic type of character structure.

So you have a very strange kind of push me, pull me situation where it looks on the surface as if the loved one is trying to help this person get out of addiction.

The kind of uncertainty of knowing if your partner will lash out and then the pain when they do followed by the making it up afterwards, this whole cycle can become for some individuals reinforcing and quite addictive and is probably mediated by dopamine. So yeah. And I think in this day and age of social media, we're all more vulnerable to getting addicted to other people because the medium itself has distilled human relationships down into their most addictive components. So we know that, for example, oxytocin, the love hormone is released when we have an intimate connection to another human being. It's involved in mother pair bonding and love bonding. And the work of my colleague Rob Malenka here at Stanford has shown that oxytocin binds to dopamine releasing neurons in the reward pathway and",

So that now more and more of us, I think, are engaging with other people in a way that is really addictive. And this explicitly plays out with dating apps.

This is really an early intervention for people with the sort of mild to moderate forms of addiction. But D essentially stands for data.

They find that they feel so much better, not just better than they did when they were going to keep with draw, but actually better than they have in a really long time.

And then those dopamine levels will stay elevated, even hours after we stop exercise, before coming back down to baseline levels, without going into that dopamine deficit state, that sets up the craving, which is why most of us don't crave exercise the next day.
