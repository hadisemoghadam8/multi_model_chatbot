I am Dr. Scott Berry Kaufman, a cognitive scientist interested in plumbing the depths of human potential. In this episode, I talk with bestselling author and my friend, Mark Manson, about what women really want in a man. In addition to writing multiple bestselling books such as The Settle Art of Not Giving A Fuck and Everything Is Fucked, Mark has a past as a successful dating coach. Mark put a lot of his insights into dating and seduction in his 2011 book, Models, Attract Women",

None of us are just attracted to a nice person, right? Like even from the male perspective, if you think about the woman you're attracted to, it's not just because they're nice. It's like the most baseline lowest bar that you can clear. It's just being a nice person. So there needs to be something else going on. Yeah, for sure. That's important to...

So obviously, there's a lot that is said about objectifying women how it's bad for women, which is true. You shouldn't objectify women.

So creepiness is, I mean, there is a physical attraction element of it. Physically attractive guys can definitely get away with more creepy behavior.

But I guess my point is that, let's define what it means to be in the friend zone because I don't think you're automatically in the friend zone. If you have a really cool friendship. The friend zone is when you are attracted to a woman and you want to have a romantic relationship with her, but she just sees you as a friend. Yes. And doesn't want to bring you out of the friend zone. Well, I think a lot of guys can really resonate with being in the friend zone and being gutted over. You know,",

I just like I don't to me, it was always really simple of like, look, you shouldn't wait around for somebody who doesn't want to be with you like period. Just if she doesn't want to be with you, don't wait around. Get on with your life. If you want to stay friends with her, that's fine. Be friends with her.
