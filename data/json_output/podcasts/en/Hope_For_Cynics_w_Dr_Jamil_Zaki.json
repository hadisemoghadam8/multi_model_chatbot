Dr. Zaki is a professor of psychology at Stanford University and the director of the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab. Using tools from psychology and neuroscience, he and his colleagues examine how empathy works and how people can learn to empathize more effectively. In this episode, we take a deep dive into the content of his new book, Hope for Sinek's, the surprising science of human goodness. We discuss his idea of hopeful skepticism and how it's different from naive optimism. According to Dr. Zaki, hopeful skepticism honors humanity's strengths while confronting our weaknesses head on.

If I can't have hope in people, given what I do, how could others? And I realized that as you're alluding to cynicism, this loss of faith in humanity has been a huge trend, not just in my life, but around the country and around the world.

It is completely understandable, given so many trends that we see in our culture. So one thing that we see, for instance, in the data, is that cynicism tends to track inequality. So in places in the world that are more unequal and in times that are more unequal, people have a harder time trusting one another as well. So that's a macro force that absolutely has",

Yeah, it often does. And the opposite of cynicism is not optimism, right? Or is not blind optimism or, you know, on optimism not grounded in truth, right? So what is the opposite of cynicism? Let me just ask you that question. Yeah, it's a great question and it depends who you ask, right?

And 85% of people think that cynics are socially smarter that they'll be better at spotting liars, for instance, than non-synics. But it turns out that basically the opposite is true. You know, cynicism is stereotyped as really smart and wise. But it's really not. A cynics actually do less well in cognitive tests than non-synics. They have a harder time spotting liars than non-synics do as well. And I think part of that is because cynicism is a blanket assumption about people. And what's the opposite",

Actually, I have a lot in common in that you're not responding to the data. You're not responding to what's in front of you.

Skepticism is not thinking like a lawyer, not having a conclusion about people that you're trying to defend, but thinking like a scientist, being open to what people have to show you. And in that way, skeptics are able to learn more quickly and they're able to be more accurate about the world around them. I love that. In your new book, you call it hopeful skepticism, which you define as the realization that people are often better than we expect. Boy, do we need that more in our lives right now?",

And, you know, it's looking at things with fresh eyes also knowing that a lot of the information that we have gotten so far, although compelling is just not accurate. You know, you talked about people connecting across identity differences, you know, which is a huge source of cynicism in our culture. It turns out that a lot of the intel that we are fed about people who are different from us is just playing wrong. And if you go on social media or look at the news, you will receive a",

And the evidence is clear that they're not. So I think it's, on the one hand, hopeful skepticism requires, as you rightly say, looking at the world with fresh eyes, but it also requires interrogating and understanding to use a sort of statistical term that are priors, our assumptions are based usually on bad intel, not bad in that it's negative, bad in that it's inaccurate.

And of course, if you live in a place which is highly competitive and people are assholes to each other, as you say, then that's going to bring out that side of you. You know, interestingly though, Scott, the time that people are at least cynical is when they focus on their local environments. So for instance, if you ask people, can most people be trusted? People are pretty negative. You know, only about a third of Americans think most people can be trusted. In some countries, it's like 6% of people believe most people can",

We just infer that assholes are everywhere else because of what we see in the media. Yes. That's really interesting. That's really interesting. I'm warning a lot from your book.

But I think that there is a missing piece to the loneliness epidemic which is that we have dim expectations of other people. And because we do we have dim expectations of how our interactions with them will go.

If you ask people what would it be like if you express gratitude to your friend? They say oh that would be awkward too. There's all these forecasts that we have where we think conversations will go poorly. And I think that's because we underestimate how friendly and warm and open other people are. We think that they don't want to contact with us. And so when we overcome that cynicism, we open new doors to improving our social health in ways",

But oftentimes we pay a lot less attention to the good stuff. And that's, you know, it makes sense from a survival perspective. It's safe to ignore a sunset but not a tsunami, right? We have to focus on threats. But it's tragic for our lives psychologically. And so savoring is just, it's related to gratitude but different.

But the fact is that when we act cynically, when we mistrust people, we actually bring out their least trustworthy side. And when instead we put faith in people, they're more likely to step up. This is what economists call earned trust. So with my graduate student, Eric Neumann, we examine, well, what happens if you explain that to people? What happens if you tell people, hey, you know, your decision to trust is not just about the risk that you take on in a social situation. Your trust is a gift that you give to somebody else and one that they are likely to repay. And we found that simply learning that, simply being aware of our influence on other people, induced folks to be more trusting, more open and more vulnerable,",
