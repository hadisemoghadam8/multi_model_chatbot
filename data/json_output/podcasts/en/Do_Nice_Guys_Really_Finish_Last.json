We'll be doing a deep scientific dive trying to answer the age-old question. Do nice guys really finish last? At the core of this question is the so-called nice guy paradox. The nice guy paradox can be stated like this. On the one hand, there's a common perception that in terms of sexual prowess and romantic relationships, nice guys finish last. On the other hand, although women often portray themselves as wanting to date kind, sensitive, and emotionally expressive men, when actually presented with a choice between this quote nice guy and an unkind, insensitive, emotionally closed, macho man or jerk, they almost always seem to reject the nice guy in favor of his more macho competitor. This paradox is everywhere in popular culture. For instance, here's",

Leney fell madly in love with the second guy. But the first guy adores you, I said, I don't even think the second guy even likes you very much. Sorry, she said, but the first guy is dull. Ouch!

Yet, research shows over and over again that those who score high and dark personality characteristics have many more sexual partners, and heck, the media loves these kinds of headlines, immediately translating correlations into causation. For instance, consider this article from the independent reporting on a correlation between being bad and number of sexual partners.

The researchers found that there were a number of different explanations for why nice guys are perceived as sexually inexperienced. One reason some women suggested was that nice guys are simply less forward with women. One wrote, to me, nice guys aren't as persistent or aggressive and don't use sleazy tactics to add another notch to their bedposts.

Now, let's talk about perceptions of bad boys in this study. Perceptions of bad boys fell into four different categories. One group of women saw bad boys as rebellious, mysterious, daring, arrogant, and dangerous. Another group saw bad boys as macho, strong, and confident. A third group viewed bad boys as fun, adventurous, spontaneous, and outgoing. And a fourth group saw the bad boy as sexy, charming, good-looking, and sexually experienced.

Bad boys were also considered to be more physically and sexually attractive, approaching relationships more casually, caring more about sex than intimate relationships, and sexually unfaithful. Look, these are college-aged women in this study, between the ages of 18 and 25 years at one university writing these responses. So the findings must be taken with a grain of salt.

On the one hand, bad boys are perceived as having some very attractive qualities, such as sexiness, confidence, charm. On the other hand, they are also seen as exhibiting negative behaviors, such as aggression and duplicity. Therefore, a number of traits are quote bad in the sense that they are related to highly selfish, exploitative mating strategies.

A reduction in both of these traits, agreeable and conscientiousness, is an integral component of a number of personality disorders that are receiving considerable research attention. In recent years, psychologists have looked at the traits and behaviors of these socially undesirable individuals, those with narcissism, macabillionism, and psychopathy.

So, in this seminal paper from 2009, Peter Jonas and his colleagues looked at the link between the dark triad personality traits and short-term mating. As you can see in this table, the number of sexual partners, as well as the motivation to seek a short-term mate, were both significantly correlated with the dark triad personality traits.

In this paper from 2012, Nicholas Holtzman and Michael Strueb make the case that people with dark personalities more generally, not just narcissism, but also psychopathy and macchi-vellianism, are really good at creating a physically attractive veneer, at least at first meeting. They conclude that, quote, dark personalities construct appearances that act as social wars, possibly facilitating their cunning social strategies. Why are narcissists so charming at first sight?

Third, an examination of observable verbal and nonverbal behaviors, as well as aspects of physical appearance revealed four main characteristics that make up the charismatic air of the narcissist. The four main characteristics of the charismatic air are attractiveness, interpersonal warmth, competence, and humor. As the researchers put it, quote, narcissism predicts all of the four relevant cue domains, attractiveness from their flashy and neat attire, interpersonal warmth from their charming glances at strangers, competence from their self-assured behavior, and humor from their owitty verbal expressions.

Dark personalities are also really good at targeting victims. Consider this study by Sarah Wheeler and colleagues, which found that people who score higher on psychopathic traits are better able to judge vulnerability to victimization after viewing very short clips of targets just walking.

So consistent with a lot of these other findings, research has found that those with dark triad traits have a very specific love style. If that's what you want to call it.

And people who do tend to treat as a game and tend to really take that competition seriously do tend to do better. But as we'll keep exploring throughout the rest of this episode, is that really the only way you have to go about it to reach your mating goals? Spoiler or no, it's not, but more on that later.

The dominant male who is demanding, violent, and self-centered is not considered attractive to most women, whereas the dominant male who is assertive and confident is considered attractive as the researchers suggest. Men who dominate others because of leadership qualities and other superior abilities and who therefore are able to and willing to provide for their families quite possibly will be preferred to potential partners who lack these attributes.

In the field of psychology, self-reported measures of dominance and prestige are being distinguished at both the behavioral level and the hormonal level.

In particular, men high in social sexuality were more likely to employ assertive strategies and women high in social sexuality were more likely to be receptive to assertive strategies. But additionally, sexism also mattered. In both the college and adult samples, women scoring high in hostile and benevolent sexism traits were more receptive to assertive courtship strategies.

It would also be interesting to see the effect of courtship behavior strategy use by females, but this study did not look at that in particular.

If you are constantly being put in the quote friend zone, perhaps you are not being assertive enough about what you want. There's a difference between dominance and assertiveness.

Five, get out of your head. Instead of worrying about falling a set of roles that puts you too much in your own head and creates unnecessary anxiety, direct your attention to the external world.

One agentic and measured by the dark tribe, and one pro-social measured with altruistic behavior, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.

If you're looking for a long-term relationship, don't put so much stock in your initial attraction and be open-minded to guys who may not be as flashy at first sight.

Longer or shorter strides, non-lateral weight shifts, gestured versus postural movements and foot movement. Potential victims tended to lift their feet higher while walking. A key factor in victimization seems to be non-verbal cues of dominance for submissiveness. We don't want to victim-bleen here, but I think knowledge is power. So can anything be done?
