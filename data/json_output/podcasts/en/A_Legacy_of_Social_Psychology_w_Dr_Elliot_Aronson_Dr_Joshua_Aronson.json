How do people relate to each other? What causes prejudice? Can prejudice be reduced by any intervention? Can education help? These are really vital issues throughout history and certainly and vital today as they've ever been. Oh, yeah, I might add to that that the center of social psychology has always been considered to be social influence.

By studying social psychology, we understand how people think, how they feel, what makes them happy, what makes them sad, how they justify their own behavior, they justify their mistakes, how a great many people, especially those in politics, tend to justify their mistakes and how that leads them to make deeper and deeper mistakes.

This was before you had a cell phone or a smartphone to entertain you and the lights were hard.

And we have to decide what is true, you know, what is currently considered true? And it's been wrenching to pull some of those great studies out.

But another one is Phil's Embodos, the Stanford prison experiment that Josh already mentioned. And that's, I think that was an interesting idea. Very, very difficult to pull off experimentally. And it wasn't pulled off well. So that there are some serious methodological flaws in that experiment.

And you want to be able to trust the people around you. And you want to have a sense that you matter, that if you weren't there, people would miss you. All of those things, and the work you're doing makes a difference. Most schools frustrate most of those motives. And that's why we're seeing a lot of the problems. You go into a school where everybody feels like they belong, they understand what the work they're doing and they understand why they're doing it. In other words, they understand the importance of what they're doing. If they feel like they trust their teachers, they get some autonomy, but also connectedness to other people.

So what it's the elegant solution to that problem is, like Jigsaw, is that you get kids working together on not just learning some material, but by producing a three-dimensional something that serves another human being. So in the case of the school that I was studying, kids learn math by raising chickens. And there is so much math involved in raising a chicken that you wouldn't get from a worksheet.

And what would you, what I asked them, what reminder would you tattoo onto your body to remind you who you are and what your purpose is? And by the end of the course, I want you to have a well thought out tattoo. I love that. And you're talking about economic fortune.

And I was, was it anything you could just talk a little about, about what that means? So I was invited to give advice about how to, about the good life. And it was like a January thing. And so there were rabbis talking about, you know, reading a year of reading.

And he goes, you want to know why? He goes, because every day I spend 10 minutes thinking about how this is going away. It's just temporary. Everything you think is, is permanent. It's going away. So get used to that feeling. And I felt myself getting lighter when I, until every day after my meditation, I spent five minutes going, this may be the last day of my life. Wow. This may be the last time I pet my dog, kiss my wife, call my father. It, it lends an incredible poignancy",

But for me, in the mindset of appreciate every moment, there's nothing like death to remind you of that. That you're, you're mortal. And, and so it takes away a lot of the fears that I had and a lot of the worries about trivial stuff. And I think that's the, that's something that I try to give to my students, even though the idea that they're contemplating death at their young age is, is it really works better when you're older.

When I hit 90, when a couple of my kids asked me, well, what should we do for your 90th birthday? That's a milestone. I thought about that and I thought, you know what?

So tell me a little bit about, are you proud of your son, Elliot? I'm proud of Josh a lot. Josh is the only one I've done to become a social psychologist. A lot of people said, don't know what a courageous thing to do. I thought of it as courageous, but I thought of it as difficult. And Josh has done some beautiful work.
