In this episode, we discuss her groundbreaking research and new book, Raising Resilience, How to Help Our Children Thrive in Times of Insurgency. A key takeaway of this conversation is the importance of being a safe anchor for your children and conveying to them that you are there for them no matter what, that you accept them whoever they are, and that you can provide a sense of safety even in their worst moments.

On the other hand, I think what we find over and over is that people, if they have community, if they have people to turn to, they can recover more than we give them credit for. And the reason that children can do OK is that parents buffer. That's so much what my new book is about. Right. Yeah. What is this buffering that parents do naturally?

How robust is that correlation, you know, between childhood trauma and the way it affects your brain and the way that you process the world as an adult? How strong is that correlation really? Well, it can be very strong if it's child, for example, is not believed. Let's say it's, you know, some kind of abuse, sexual abuse, some, or just bad things happen that people want to quickly brush under the carpet, even if they're known.

But because in graduate school, I worked with adults who were coming with this set of behaviors or problems that they were reporting that turned out to be really related to their childhood traumas. And they didn't have support to process them. So you can still do that as an adult.

And then our Chris Frailies research, you know, yeah, just showing that like there's no such thing as a securely attached person. It's where we're all just like on a continuum of the two actually is avoidant and anxious. And we're just secure to the extent to which we score low in these two dimensions of personality.

Researchers were doing that original research in a very scientific experimental paradigm. People still do. But then it springs into our more common knowledge. And I think both gets watered down and maybe misunderstood.

And his definition of self-regulation is not inhibiting emotions. It really is about using it and channeling it contextually. Appropriate. Is that how you see so far? Absolutely.

So there's obviously the part of that connecting with the child as a parent, but also developing in the child, the social skills, so they're developing with other kids, you know, positively. How important is it for children to develop these social skills for like, how important is it really? Yeah. Yeah. It's a great question.
