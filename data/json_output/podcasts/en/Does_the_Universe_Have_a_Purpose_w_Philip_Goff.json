Hello, and welcome to The Psychology Podcast. Today, I'd like to welcome Philip Goff to the show. Philip is a British author, philosopher, and professor at Durham University, whose research focuses on philosophy of mind and consciousness. In this episode, we discuss his latest book, Why, The Purpose of the Universe. This is a very deep book. And therefore, this was a pretty deep discussion. In this episode, we discuss topics such as evidence for the existence of God, what physics says about the probability of there being a God, and whether the universe has a purpose. We also discuss the function of religion and society, and Philip's own views on what form God would take based on the latest evidence. And in probably my favorite",

Yeah, all wrapped up now, ready to retire. But, you know, actually, Scott, your podcast was one of the first time I went on. It's not a while ago.

Well, I mean, actually, because, you know, my recent book, modestly titled Why the Purpose of the Universe, you know, most of it is doing what I do. It's the sort of cold-blooded scientific philosophical argument for something. But in the final chapter, I do get to these big questions. Right? What's the point of it all? Why are we here?

And then at the other extreme, you've got the familiar secular humanist position, like, probably is no purpose to the universe. But even if there is, it's kind of irrelevant, you know, we make our own meaning and purpose. That's all there is to it. I guess I take a middle way point of view, you know, if there's no God, if there's no purpose to the universe, we can still live meaningful lives by doing things that are worth doing, you know, pursuing kindness, creativity, the pursuit of knowledge and so on.

Yeah, I guess the position I've reached after struggling back and forth for many years is that both sides of this never-ending debate have something right and something wrong. You know, I think so many people in the West think, I think you have to believe in the very traditional idea of God as all knowing or powerful, perfectly good, all your secular atheists.

Do you know actually the terms of my response from friends and colleagues, I found most of my atheist friends have said, oh, this is just nonstandard atheism.

Okay, that would be controversial, that there's some kind of designer. What it actually means, and this is a familiar term in physics, is just that for life to be possible, these numbers had to fall in a certain very narrow range. I mean, let's take an example, put an example on the table. One of the most discussed cases is the cosmological constant that measures the force that propels the accelerating expansion of the universe. We discovered in 1998. I remember, actually, as a young kid interested in black holes and so on. We discovered that our universe is not only expanding, but it's accelerating in its expansion. When you calculate what the number is, that governs the force, we call it dark energy, the postulated",

Whereas, if it was a bit weaker, it wouldn't have counteracted gravity, and so everything would have collapsed back on itself a split second after the big bang. So, if a life to be possible, that number had to be kind of like Goldilocks porridge, not too big, not too small, kind of exactly right, or not, you know, it's not one number that's needed, but it's in a quite narrow range.

They may change that you'll get less fine tuning. They may change that you'll get more fine tuning, but I think, you know, we've got to work with the evidence we currently have. What follows from that is another question, but just let me let me say, I am inclined, honestly, to think we're kind of sort of in denial about this as a society. I think it's a little bit like when we first started getting evidence that we were in the center of the universe, and people struggled to accept that. Sorry, that we weren't. What",

But I think every generation absorbs a world view that they can't see beyond. And I think we've got so I think in our normal standard way of thinking about evidence, I think, and we can maybe debate this. I think this is evidence for some kind of goal directedness towards life in the early universe.

It's got a fortunate universe and it's interesting that one of them, Luke, is a question and takes this in a, in a theistic direction, whereas Jarent his co-writer is an atheist that thinks the multiverse is the best explanation, but so most of the book is just the evidence and then they have a sort of dialogue at the end.

We haven't bought general relativity and quantum mechanics together. Maybe when we do that, this will go away. But it's equally possible there'll be more fine tuning and I think all you can ever do is work with the evidence you currently have.

The fact that you argue there's psychophysical harmony, the improbable alignment between consciousness and behavior that is pre supposed in any evolutionary story of the character of our conscious experience.

Right. He distinguishes the easy problems, so called and the hard problem. So the easy problems are kind of to do with behavior or information processing. What stuff does and science knows how to deal with that. You postulate a mechanism to explain the behavior. But Charmers thinks those kind of things always leave open the hard problem.

If experience and behavior are sort of logically separable, why do they fit together so well? I mean, the most obvious examples are pleasure and pain. When something hurts, you avoid it. And that's kind of appropriate. If something feels bad, that gives you a reason to avoid it. If something feels good, you tend to go for it. And that makes sense as well.

And I don't think evolution does it because, I mean, I think, I look, I believe in evolution. I think we evolved the consciousness we have. But I think any evolutionary explanation of our consciousness presupposes what I'm talking about presupposes, that behavior and consciousness go together in a kind of rationally appropriate way. Like, natural selection is only going to make me feel pain when my body's damaged.

Actually, this chapter of the book chapter three does have a warning on it that it's a bit more complicated. But here's a simpler point. There's a deep mystery of why consciousness evolved at all because natural selection just cares about behavior. That's what matters for survival. But we've found with AI now that you can have incredibly complex behavior and incredibly complex information processing with no inner life at all. Why didn't natural selection just make us complicated survival mechanisms that can mechanically track features of the environment and initiate survival",

And then you have all argument why the omnigod probably doesn't exist. But I guess this helped me swear this away. I would have thought, maybe I might understand correctly, but since you're like the guy when it comes to the theory of panpsychism, right? Isn't panpsychism literally an argument for an omnipresent consciousness?

You know, so exciting that 15 years ago nobody was panpsychist, you know, and it's just been this growing third-way position that's quite exciting. But there is a split, I think, maybe reminiscent of the split in the early psychoanalytic community between followers of young and followers of Freud, you know, followers of young took it in a spiritual direction with the collective unconscious and spiritual archetypes.

But yeah, so, I mean, this started really learning much more about actually how the Eastern Orthodox Church thinks about things, whether it's much less of an emphasis on sin, and there's much more of an emphasis on unity.

But this idea that, you know, it's all about God and the universe coming into harmony, makes a lot more sense to me on both levels.

So this is, so this is something, let me just say very finally, I am very uncertain. This is true, but I've come to think of it as a credible possibility because I think it fits well with this God of limited powers hypothesis because it kind of resonates spiritually.

That there's good evidence that there is some kind of purpose or goal directedness going on. There's something going on. Yeah. But what it is, I'm much less certain about this, this form of mildly heretical Christianity. I've come to think is a credible possibility, but I'm very open to the possibility that other religions might also be credible possibilities.

We're launching this season with a mini series, Totally Nostalgia. A four part series about the Latinos who shaped pop culture in the early 2000s. It's Lava checking in with all things. Y2K 2000s. My favorite memory, honestly, was us having our own media platforms like Mondos and MTV 3.

I think that just a big, a big disappointment for me if you're right is that like, like praying, an implication of what you're saying is that praying is useless. Like, you know, that there really is not a God or there really is not something higher than me that cares about me, you know, beyond my parents.

And, and for the remainder of this podcast, I want to just jump into some really, really deep territory. And that's this, are people, when they're having a, a peak experience or a mystical experience, are they seeing reality? That's a question that I have been pondering for the past 70 years, you know, wrote the book, Transcend. And I think it's a really interesting question. I just say they are for a second.

There is some level of, of, yeah, I'm not going matrix, I'm not going all matrix, but I'm saying there is something that is pointing to a loving unity of a universe, of a consciousness. There's something very loving and one of humanity that is very hard for humans in the ordinary consciousness to access, but I think it's probably true. What do you think?

Some panpsychists see a constant and certain spiritual views. And I think it does perhaps open you up to taking mystical experiences more seriously. I mean, if you're a physicalist and you think it's just physics is the complete story of the fundamental nature of reality, you've got to think a mystical experience is a delusion, it's just something funny going on in your brain because, you know, at least if you haven't experienced it, there's some greater form of consciousness of the root of things.

Right, that's what you need to know about quantum mechanics, right? It's our best scientific theory. All of our technology is based on it, but there is no consensus on what it is telling us about reality. There are these different views and it requires philosophical judgment call in what the hell is this telling us?

Yeah, shut up and you know, we need, we need to, we've forgotten the, we can't do without philosophy. There are these choice points where there are judgment calls like mystical experience.
