Hello, and welcome to the psychology podcast. I'm Dr. Scott Barricolfmann, a cognitive scientist interested in the science of intelligence, creativity, and human potential. Today we have a very special guest on the show, Dr. Howard Gardner. Dr. Gardner is a developmental psychologist and a professor of cognition and education at Harvard's Graduate School of Education. He was a founding member of Harvard Project Zero in 1967 and has written hundreds of research articles in over 30 books, including his most recent books, the Essential Howard Gardner on Mind, and the Essential Howard Gardner on Education. His most well-known book, however, is his 1983 book, Frames of Mind, the Theory of Multiple Intelligence. This book",

On a personal note, when I was an undergraduate, I remember coming across this book and deciding then and there that I wanted to spend the rest of my life studying this topic. I credit Howard Gardner as being one of the most important influences on my decision to go into the field of psychology. I was actually accepted to be his graduate student to be co-advised by him and the late Kurt Fisher, but ultimately I decided to study with Robert Sternberg for graduate school, who also has done groundbreaking work on human intelligence. This is a very lively discussion with a person who I deeply respect. My own thinking on intelligence has evolved quite a bit since I was an undergrad, and it was",

I came from a family of German Jews who escaped from the Nazis literally in the nick of time. They arrived here on the night of the broken glass in November, 1938.

And when I was 16, so in high school, he gave me a textbook in psychology. It's actually one was written by Norman Munn who was a well-known psychologist. And I leafed through the book and I realized that the book could explain something about me which I'd always been mystified by. And that is I'm colorblind and I can't see colors.

But I ended up not liking history because in our tutorial, we read historiography, which is not history, but rather how people think about history. And I was too young and naive to realize that that's an interesting question. Now being in my 80s, I realized it's a fascinating question. But at Harvard at that time in the early 1960s, there was a field called Social Relations, nicknamed a Sock Rail, and it gave you exposure to psychology, sociology, and anthropology, a little bit of economics and political science.

And the crisis of adolescence, which my friends and me were so interested in, is the crisis of identity versus role diffusion. Identity means you sort of put yourself together, you know where you're going, you have a future, you feel pretty confident and competent. And role diffusion is, I don't know what I want to do this, I don't know whether I want to laugh, do I married, do I move away, do I switch my hobbies.

That's well, thank you, I put that on my list. Who else influenced you around that time at Harvard? Was there anyone else that had a major influence? The person who, by far, had the greatest influence on me was a person I worked with right after college. That was Jerome Bruner, known as Jerry Bruner, and he was a great cognitive psychologist, one of the people who founded the field which opposed skin area and then behaviorism.

And that curriculum raised three questions which I think about every day. What makes human beings human? How can we get that way? And how can we be made more so? How can we be made more human? And I'm happy to talk about that for the next hour because I think it's the most important question. We as a species face today, but I want to stick with your question.

But at Harvard almost 60 years ago, he started a research group called Prajik Zero which was studying artistic education and artistic knowledge. And as I mentioned, I was very involved with music and also with other arts. And I realized that the psychology, almost nobody paid attention to what it meant to become an artist.

The other NG, very different was Norman Geshwin.

You can only ask those questions of somebody where nature causes a stroke or some other kind of compromising of an area of the brain. And so then I changed my post doc plans and spent 20 years working in the phasia center in the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital learning about what different parts of the brain do and different kinds of cognitive faculties that we have as human beings and how they can be impaired through brain damage.

And I realized that the notion of intellect is being singular and in fact if you were smart you'd be smart in everything. If you were average, you'd be averaging everything.

But I realized that I wasn't really talking about kinds of mines. I was talking about different mental faculties, which I came to call it different intelligences. And that led to frames of mine to theory of multiple intelligences.

Learning styles is a claim that people learn in certain ways and that you have to teach them in those ways. That's an empirical claim. And they may be some stylistic categories which are helpful. But when people talk about something like a visual learning style or auditory learning style, I think that's rubbish. I mean, they often use the word visual for people who have trouble reading, but of course reading is not well analyzed.

So that's individuation. pluralization is figure out what's important and teach it more than one way. And any good teacher has more arrows and is a herb quiver than just one way of teaching.

And certainly in human prehistory going back thousands of years, this determined whether you survived or not in the southern African areas where human beings started. But nowadays where we use naturalist intelligence is when we go to the grocery store or to a shopping center or go to go to Amazon and we try to decide which of two shoes to buy, which of two hairdryers to buy or which of two idols to buy, we're using the same brainwear that was developed",

My favorite memory, honestly, was us having our own media platforms like Mondos and MTV 3. You could turn on the TV, you see Thalia, you see JLo, Nina Sky, Evie Queen, all the girlies doing their things, all of the beauty reflected right back at us. It was everything.

What do you do with the fact that all your intelligence don't fit the criteria completely? Are you okay with that? Yeah, well, this would take us an hour to speak, but when I wrote frames of mine, I laid out eight criteria for intelligence, and they arranged from evidence of brain evidence, from psychology tests, to evidence in different cultures, to genetic kind of evidence, and nothing made the final list unless it got a hard-cooked score on most of",

What I should mention, and this is available in my website, with my colleagues, Shinri Fu Rizawa, and Annie Chikure, we wrote a 10,000 word essay earlier this year called Who Owns Intelligence?

And then I, with my very limited knowledge, but with my considerable interest, talked about artificial intelligence, and to what extent it fits these different criteria. And this is mentioned in the two books, The Essentials, if I were given another 10 or 20 years, I would love to be able to consider not just human intelligence, but animal plant and artificial, because I think that's the next frontier for say, psychology in the large sense.

So there's no need to wait for that. But we have to remember then when I went into this field which was in the late 1960s, we hardly had cat scans. We didn't have MRIs and there was no real no real way of investigating what was going on in the brain as we say in vivo. So now the question is almost the opposite.
