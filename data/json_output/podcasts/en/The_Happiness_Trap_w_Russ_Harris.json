Russ is one of Australia's foremost practitioners of acceptance and commitment therapy, a mindfulness-based psychological therapy that aims to help you reduce stress, overcome fear, and find fulfillment. In this wide-ranging episode on mental health, we discuss Russ's happiness trap cards, which include ideas such as your mind is not your enemy, when emotional storms blow up, drop anchor, and urges are like waves. We also cover our self-esteem, the experience of being human, and how to set yourself up for success in life. I'm a long-time admirer of Russ Harris, and I'm so glad I was finally able to chat with him on my podcast. So with that further ado, I bring you Russ Harris. Russ Harris, how are you? Great, thank you. Thanks for inviting me.",

Yes, I think we all feel that way at times. Definitely. Because your background is in ACT, is that right? Yeah, like your official constitution is act. Yeah, that's right. If you cool at ACT within a shot of Professor Stephen Hayes, the guy, he actually comes, he pops out in like the candy man. Yeah, that way.

Let's just say, this collection of cards, the Happiness Trap Cards is really all-encompassing. I mean, as I'm reading it, I'm like, wow, he's covering from self-esteem to thinking, thinking traps to living a life of gratitude. I mean, it's really, it's all mental life. Yeah, I look, it was much harder creating the cards than it was writing the book.

It sounds like it's like a tweet. Everything's a tweet. Yeah, yeah, I've never been onto the Twitter space. Well, I tell a lie, I was on it for about a month and then I gave up. It was just to be stressful. It just is like an entryway into act. Can you just tell people a little bit, like what are the core, what's the core concept of unhooking?

Yeah, well, so basically, difficult thoughts and feelings show up for all of us throughout the day, every day, you know, life is stressful. We all have challenges. And the human mind often interprets things in a way that makes things even more stressful than they need to be. So when I use the term hooked, what it means is your thoughts and feelings are having a huge impact on you. They're jerking you around. They may pull your attention away from what's important, what's meaningful. So you're no longer focused on what you're doing, you're no longer engaged in what you're doing. Or they may hook you in other ways, pull you into patterns of behaviour that are self-defeating that make life worse rather than better, you know, drugs or alcohol or, you know, shouting at people that",

One of this approach is obviously very similar as well to Susan David's idea of emotional agility, right? Yeah, absolutely. Susan David uses acceptance and commitment therapy. She acknowledges it at the back of the book that she doesn't really mention it throughout the book, but yes, her book is absolutely based on the same approach. And we've had a retta as the guest speaker at the world at conference. And she said she didn't kind of reference it throughout the book because she didn't want her book to be filled",

And so unhooking skills are a set of skills that you use to take the power and impact out of those difficult thoughts and feelings. It's not about getting rid of them or suppressing them. It's about just kind of having a new way of interacting with them so they just lose their power. They become like water off a duck's back. They can't jerk you around. When did you get so interested in this approach? Well, it was started from a personal journey. I mean, I graduated as a junior doctor in my 20s and I was, you know, miserable. I was depressed. I was anxious. And I couldn't understand why. I mean, you know, being a doctor, everyone said that was going to make your life brilliant. You know, it's prestige, status, it's",

And basically what happened was through my own personal therapy and through reading lots of self-help books and doing lots of self-development. I started to become very interested in the psychological aspects of medicine and lose a much interest in the physical side. And so I was, I was working as a GP, family doctor in Melbourne, Australia. And I found that as a GP, my consultations with my patients were getting longer and longer and longer. And we were talking more and more about the psychological sides of health and less and less about the physical side. And I started to realize that I was in the wrong profession. Gradually, I started retraining as",

So I, you know, it's a couple of long stories short. I arrived at Act through a long journey of trial and error and blind alleys, training in many different models of therapy. And each model I found some things that I liked and some things that I didn't like and some things that worked and other things that didn't work.

I really like it too. How would you describe the difference between Act and Collegiate Behavioral Therapy, particularly the new crop of it, the mindful Collegate Behavioral Therapy that my friend Seth Gillhand is kind of spearheading? Yeah, well, you know, I think it's a hard question to answer because Collegiate Behavioral Therapy is evolving all the time and Act has massively influenced it. So a lot of stuff from Act has actually crept into CBT. Traditionally, probably the biggest",

You acknowledge your thoughts, you recognize that even the most difficult negative thoughts are at some level your mind actually trying to help you. When you're worrying a lot, your mind's trying to help you in, you know, point out things that are dangerous, point out things that you need to take action on. And so I often describe the mind as like an overly helpful friend, you know, Scott, have you ever had one of those overly helpful friends? Yeah.

We don't have to fight with them. We can just learn to let them flow through us and have them. And so that's probably the biggest difference, instead of fighting good as beauty, we can just let the thoughts, you know, float on by like water off a dot's back really. Right, right, right.

But it act is a bit different to other models in that it doesn't emphasize meditation. Right. Meditation is, let's be honest, for a lot of people, it's very boring and very difficult. So it kind of teaches mindfulness through lots of simple, easy to implement strategies that you can build into everyday life, you know, without meditating. Yeah, yeah. Good point.

So it's not deliberately trying to make you miserable. It's actually trying to help you. Unfortunately, that strategy is not a particularly useful strategy, you know, judging and beating ourselves up. It does sometimes motivate us, but other times it has the opposite of effect.

You end up with a happy, healthy donkey with really good night vision, right? But we've, we've got something much more motivating than carrots.

I hope so, you know, I mean, self-compassion is such an important part of the problem. You know, a default setting for most of this is we just judge and criticize ourselves. And, and, you know, again, just like sometimes that will motivate a donkey to carry the load, it will motivate us at times. But it's a, a life training form of motivation.

Yeah. And usually it's so different to what they're actually saying to them self instead of this harsh criticism, there's this really kind and supportive language comes out.

And so it's the same with emotional storms for it, you know, for our, when the going gets tough, we have emotional storms. For some people, it's anxiety, storms. For some people, there's sort of depressing storms for some people. There's that anger that basically we get jerked around by these painful emotions. And they sweep us away.

So, yeah, I like this metaphor, the idea that life is like a stage show that's changing all the time from moment to moment and on that stage. On that stage, there's all your thoughts, all your feelings, everything that you can see in here and touch and taste and smell. And it's continually changing.

As I said earlier in act, we don't really get into meditation that much, but there are other ways of building up this kind of observer part, which is useful.

So just to continue this, sailboat metaphor and sea metaphor, how are urges like waves? Oh, yeah. Well, so an urge is like a wave in the sense that if you watch a wave, it rises, it reaches a peak or a crest, and then it falls again into a trough, and then it rises, the peak is some falls. And our emotions are like that. Our urges are like that. Even the most intense emotions, they will actually rise and reach a peak and then fall. Even when you're really",

Yes, yes, I've been thrown around by the waves before. And that's what you mean by surfing. You don't want to resist a wave, right? Because what happens if you do resist a wave? No, no. If you resist it, you get slammed. And so surfing a wave means you kind of ride it. And it's the same with our own urges, cravings and tense emotions.
