I hope this episode gives you a greater glimpse into his own psychology, and I hope this episode also even increases your own interest in the exciting field of mentalism, which I find extraordinarily exciting. Without further ado, I bring you Banachek. Banachek, welcome to the psychology podcast. Thank you. The amazing doctor Scott, is that what we were saying?

Okay, I have a real hard time promoting myself, what talking to myself in terms like that. It's good for marketing, and you know, it's kind of like, it depends who you're asked, you know, what are you looking at a mentalist? And there's different types of mentalists, you know, there's pure mentalists, which is sort of like me, but I'm also a pure mentalist with a skeptic bent that wants people by the time I'm done to realize it's strictly entertainment.

I used to think it was all about the props that the performer used, right? If they used something look like it was magical, then it felt magical, but I think it's more about the performance now. It looks like magic tricks. It's mentalism actually looks like a magic trick. You don't misunderstand or you don't confuse it with like psychic powers, or that could have been psychic.

So how would you define mentalism, you know, like a sentence? Yeah, well, I really pushed it in one of my books. It was in terms of taking my five known senses to create the illusion of a six sense. And that came from a gentleman who years ago did one lecture, and he basically, it was by the wayside, and then the amazing Randy, because I was looking for a way, I didn't want people",

We take our five known senses to duplicate what psychic powers would look like if they were real. We use verbal communication, nonverbal communication, magic, lots of magic, mostly magic, and it's a psychology to create what wouldn't look like it was a genuine psychic experience. You're not going to call yourself a mentalist if you're a psychic. There would be no reason to do that.

It's interesting how people react to mentalism because, you know, I'm nowhere near your level, but just for fun, you know, when I do mentalism, I often get the reaction, hey, you're cheating. And it's like, well, it's like, well, of course I am.
