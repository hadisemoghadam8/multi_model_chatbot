Dr. Gray is a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina, an author of the new book called Outraged, Why We Fight About Morality in Politics and How to Find Common Ground. Wow, what a timely book and timely episode. In this discussion, we discuss why people seem so divided today, and why everyone seems to be filled with outrage for the other side. We also discuss the psychology of righteous indignation, and Dr. Gray's views on moral psychology, and his argument that, deep down, we all have the same harm-based moral mind. We also discuss how we can bridge moral divides. I'm a long-time admirer of Kurt's Seminole Research on Morality and his theory of moral typecasting, where we treat victims as angels and perpetrators as pure evil. I learned a lot from this discussion, and I'm",

Why We Fight About Morality in Politics and How to Find Common Ground. Yeah, I really want to know the answer to all those questions. Yeah, the only questions you're asking your book. Now, you got to pitch the in social psychology from Harvard, right? Was it relating to morality? That's right.

My dissertation was on how the feeling of pain and a little bit pleasure, but mostly pain changes on the intention of the person who's giving it to you. So if you think someone's hurting you maliciously, giving you an electric shock, I did a lot of shocking of Harvard undergraduates. If you think you're getting shocked intentionally and maliciously, it physically hurts more than if you think you're getting shocked accidentally, or benevolently, hard to imagine getting shocked benevolently, but we figured out how to make that happen.

It's kind of more international collaborations, funding, scholars, things like that. So they're kind of connected with each other. But it's busy, for sure. Yeah.

So increasingly, not only have policy positions moved apart, as much as really any kind of average person, you know, is really focused on policy. It's usually kind of focused on our group identity. But policy positions have moved apart. It's also the case that your dislike of the other party has gone up and up every year.

I think over the decades, it's been increasingly about entertainment, right? So the first televised debate where Kennedy looks so much better than Nixon, for instance. And then we get to where, I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, right? Even Reagan, you know, was president in the 80s. And so I think it's increasingly become about, you know, who you trust.

Concerns about protecting ourselves and our family. Yes. You say deep in our minds every fight about morality comes down to one thing, competing perceptions of harm. We get outraged at people when they deny our assumptions about what causes suffering and when they reject our views of victimhood. Well, this is just, this is right, my alley.

If you're, if you're kind of pro-immigration, maybe you think the victim are family's fleeing violence at the border. And if you're more anti-immigration, you think the victims are citizens harmed by, you know, undocumented or illegal immigrants. And so, you know, our moral judgments are tied to those perceptions.

And it's, and I don't even know if you fully realize how relevant it is to the moment when it's, so I feel like we're living in the age of competitive victimhood. Absolutely.

So no one wants to like suffer, but if there's a conflict and one person is labeled a perpetrator and one person or side is the victim, everyone wants to be the victim instead of the perpetrator. Yeah, who wants to be the perpetrator? Yeah, right. Again, because we all think of ourselves as good people. No one's like, you know what? I'm the one who's like victimizing people here.

We, you know, you're the expert on personality. I feel like we cite a little bit of stuff in one chapter on people who, who have like a victimhood mindset.

Yes. That's exactly right. So, okay, let's, let's, let's talk more about the excellent argument in your book. You know, it's interesting you because you do make the case that we have a harm based moral mind. Is that always the case? Are there instances of moral thinking that don't involve harm?

So it's always about, it's always about harm. That's so like my gut tells me like, oh, there's got to be an example. I can think of that dispels that, but I can't go, you're right.

But I was trying to think, do you know what I'm saying? I'm trying to think of examples he gives of just disgust response, which is not actually causing anyone harm in some of his classic vignettes.

And I just know that, you know, I acknowledge that there might be some suffering caused.

Yeah, great question, and I think ultimately it comes down to our nature, and that's a nature I think we've misunderstood for a long time. So if you think about, you know, who we are deep down, who we have all das, you look at museum dioramas, right? Let's say the museum natural history. And there's like pictures of cavemen and women with spears hunting mammoths. And I think that's mostly not true, not in the misive evolution. So to hunt a mammoth or any big animal, right? You need stone tip spears, you need a lot of coordination. We didn't have stone",

We slept in the night, and our children got eaten by cougars, right? So our entire psychology is built around concern about getting harmed and protecting ourselves. And you can draw kind of almost a straight line from millions of years ago being afraid to being afraid today, not of animal predators, but of moral predators. Yeah, that's a great kind of tracing that evolution of this. So it is something really deeply ingrained in",

Like just the history that's kind of baked into all sorts of places in our brain. You're such a social psychologist. Clearly, there's a, I mean, if it's an evolutionary, you just made the argument, you're definitely, there is definitely it's in our genes.

And so maybe this is a little more kind of like in the science than is in the book. But we have a kind of template in our mind. So here's an example of a template. Let's say, I say like, what's it like to go to a restaurant? And then your template is like, well, I sit down and someone comes and takes my order and then brings me food, right? And if something was that was exactly, you know, you sit down and",

So if you're like, look, this acts victimizes someone vulnerable like child abuse, you're like, that's obviously immoral. And then the more it kind of resembles that kind of thing, the more you think your mind kind of detects something in the world as immoral, right? And so if you're like, well, you know, I kick something out in the woods. I'm like, okay, well, I'm assuming it's a tree. So it's probably all right.

And what we find is that Conservatives, we're talking like committed conservatives, seven out of seven on a conservative scale, they think that all people are around about equally vulnerable to suffering. So whether you're white or black, whether you're an immigrant or a citizen, whether you're a Muslim or Christian, you're roughly the same.

And, and that conversation went when much better than it could have because he felt like I was trying to understand and not win. So it can work even in kind of extreme cases. Yeah.

Like absolutely that takes a special person who's, who's willing to over, you know, like you're going to sit down with someone who thinks that you're less than human. That, wow, that takes a ton of fortitude and compassion and patience. And there, there are people out there who are willing to do it and, and British advice.

I mean, I think there are lots of reasons why facts don't bridge divides today. Right. We have different media environments on the left and the right, social media bubbles. But I think, you know, if we go back to evolution, right, our genes and our brains, we've never really been well equipped to deal with statistics, to deal with, you know, these kind of distributed facts that we're, we're talking about today, right?

And so when you're in conversations, especially when you feel threatened, right? You're not going to really think about the truth of statistics. You're going to, you're going to kind of anchor on to these stories, especially these stories of threat. And so this is why I think facts, you know, are great.

So, you know, yeah, Stephen Pinker asked me a question actually when I was a second year grad student about, you gave a presentation about moral exemplars like mother Teresa and his question was basically like, I know you think that, you know, you have in your study that mother Teresa is a hero, but like, wasn't she actually kind of cruel and callous to the people she took care of?
