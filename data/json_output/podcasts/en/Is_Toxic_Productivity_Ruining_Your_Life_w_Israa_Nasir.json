Today it's great to have Israel Nasir on the podcast. Israel is an author, speaker, and therapist whose latest book is about toxic productivity. In this episode, we discuss her definition of toxic productivity. Why addressing our emotional foundation is one of the most important parts of healing and fulfillment, and how we can challenge the instinct to trust the negative beliefs we hold for ourselves. We also discuss the importance of self-care, the connection between productivity and self-worth, and how to transform shame into curiosity. This was an important chat on",

And the third is how good you feel about yourself is connected to the outcome. So when these three things start happening, yeah, yeah, then you're just kind of in this, I call it a paradox because it's like self fulfilling in some ways. And kind of like a catch 22, but you could call it a storm. To a lot of people with low feelings of self worth.

So trying to do things collect achievements collect gold stars so that you feel like you're you know you fit in like you and I can sit here and I can feel good about myself because I just did XYZ. And so it definitely feels good in the moment. So there's no denying that. But it's not long term and it's not sustainable. Yeah, it's definitely sustainable or else it wouldn't be called toxic. Yes.

So you might want healthy productivity, but the method of getting there. If it's still imbalance and unhealthy, it's not going to be healthy. So that's something I want to say is you know, healthy productivity shouldn't just become another thing you compare yourself to with others. Yeah, love that. Yeah, the best healthy product. Exactly. Like, oh, they're healthier than me. I have to change this and I'm not good enough and all of that stuff.

So is your productivity coming from a desire to mask shame? Or is it coming from a desire to genuinely learn about the world? Right? So your intention and the root matters. That's what defines, I think, the difference a little bit. And healthy productivity, I think, to me, is a different definition. It includes rest. It includes stepping away. It includes boundaries. It includes all of these things. When we are in toxic productivity, we are trying to earn rest. But healthy productivity has rest baked into the process itself. And finally, it's more process oriented than outcome or progress oriented. Kent and toxic productivity still be productive. Oh, yeah. I heard an interview with Elon Musk once.

Exactly. Or like, as if I'm like evangelizing a life of idleness and laziness. And that in itself makes me see how people see the world in this like stark binary. If you're productive, you're productive. If you're not, then you're idle and lazy. Right? And so we get so scared. And so that creates a lot of fear and shame. But another thing I'll say is productivity on its own is not a bad thing. Progress is important. That's how our culture moves. That's how we have innovation. Elon Musk has done a million things, even though somewhat questionable at this point as a public figure. But he's changed a lot of things because of this. Dry",

When you have a very strong deadline, you might be working a lot. But that shouldn't be your whole life. And so welcome the seasons of rest and just ease and intention. And then if things are happening, you can rise to the occasion. Because if you're like that all the time, you are likely going to burn out. Yeah, when I was reading your book, I really thought of this distinction that Robert Ballerun makes between harmonious and obsessive passion. I was wondering if you ever came across that distinction in the positive psychology literature. No, but tell me that sounds so interesting. Yeah, it seems right up your alley. So harmonious passion is a passion for something but it's well integrated into your identity. And it's",

Where with obsessive passion, you are not able to disengage from something. Like if your partner or something wants to have a date night or whatever, you say no, I can't. I mean, we're continuing working. You still work even when it's not paying off dividends and your personal life would have burnt out. It was when you just had burnout. But harmonious passion is so much healthier and has been correlated with well-being and Robert Ballerun has done so much research just showing that that pathway is much more sustainable route. Yeah. So that might be irrelevant. I love it. Because you're right, like, you know, when we are harmonious, if you will, you're integrated. Your sense of self is integrated and integration requires awareness and intention",

So like, of course, if you can regulate your emotions, you can have a lot of emotional resilience, but you're also less reactive. You're also a better decision maker, right? And so, I mean, resiliency, like everybody defines it a little differently, right? So yes, I think it's a part of resiliency, but it's not the only thing. It's partly umbrella. Yeah. Yeah.

And my primary work is in digital health. So I do clinical strategy and operations at health tech startups, for mental health. But the book happened because I do a lot of things.

And because I'm a therapist, my first question to myself was, am I depressed? So I did the, you know, PHQ, which is an assessment for depression. And I didn't really meet the criteria, but I felt very disconnected from my life. So I just started doing some research to find answers on motivation, social development, learning, human behavior, that kind of stuff.

I, the thing is some of these things are so deeply embedded in our worldview that when your resilience is low, when you're in back to resilience, when you're stressed out, your most conditioned habits come to the surface. Right. So this unlearning journey that I was on and changing my habits and my worldview, I think has given me a new perspective on how to deal with stressful times in my life.

But I think one of the biggest, or I should say one of the saddest things about living on autopilot is you're not living in the present. You're not actually engaged in the relationships that you have. You're not engaged in the life that you're living. You feel like you have no choice or agency anymore.

So I think that was one of the bigger challenges that I was trying to take on when I first started the research. A lot of the research is rooted in workplace culture. But my stuff was coming from other places. It was coming from needing to have my life look a certain away now that I moved to New York. And I was newly married. And so I did start finding very new research on the fact that we can bring this mindset to other domains of our life. So the biggest one I see nowadays is self-care. Before it was like, okay, I'm",
