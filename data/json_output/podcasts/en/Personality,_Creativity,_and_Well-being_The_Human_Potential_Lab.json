Welcome to another episode of the Human Potential Lab, where I teach you the latest science of important psychological concepts that are relevant to your daily life. Today, I'm going to be teaching you about the intersection of personality, creativity, and well-being. These are all three things that are very interesting to people, and when you look at the integration of them, you can really get close to a life well-lived. So first off, I want to just do a little primer on what is personality? A lot of people think of personality as this thing that is ingrained, that doesn't change much throughout our lives, that you are either an extrovert, or you're an introvert. You are either highly",

Turns out the personality is actually something that is quite fluid and can be context dependent. It's partly determined by our genes, and it's also partly determined by the environment. But when we talk about personality, we're just talking about what psychology is called density distributions. So throughout the course of your day, you tend to score more introverted, let's say, in most of your actions, like a four or five on a five point scale. But you may have your moments where you're extremely extroverted. Maybe you get really inspired to stand on a table and dance. Who knows? You know what the context can bring out of a human. So I think it's important, first of all, to just say that personality is not something said in stone and",

Now, we can through a lot of intense effort try to change our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. And in doing so change, important parts of our personality, but we can also accept a lot of our patterns, of thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and embrace our personality. So it's only up to you to decide what you want to embrace and self-accept and what you want to change. And the good news is that you can change your personality.

We call it the big two of personality. So at the highest level of description in the personality hierarchy, we can note that humans differ in the extent to which they feel stable in their lives. They feel emotionally stable. They feel like they can reach their goals and move toward their goals even with internal disruptions, such as emotional upset, as well as external disruptions, like a traumatic episode that happens. So people do differ in their personality in terms of how high they score in stability. But we also need to acknowledge there's a second part of personality called plasticity, which is the extent to which you're flexible and capable of adapting and changing. Both stability",

Actually, the science of cybernetic is actually the study of organic goal-directed systems. And that includes humans. And also includes other systems, other biological systems that are goal-oriented like us. But any goal-directed organism must have a certain degree of stability, as well as plasticity to fully thrive.

But underneath each of those are two main aspects that really make up that big five. You could go even lower to the facet level and have all sorts of facets. There can be an unlimited number of facets associated with each aspect of the big five.

So that's the dimension, the extraversion slash introversion dimension of personality. Modern day personality psychologist view it as a single continuum. So to the extent to which you score higher on the extraversion polls, the extent to which you're less of an introvert. And then the more you score high to the left of the on the pole to the introversion side, the less you are an extrovert. And that's how modern day personality psychologist tend to think of it. The two main aspects of extroversion are enthusiasm and assertiveness. Let's look at some of the items and see how they're tested to see maybe where you score on these two.

And in fact, most people score somewhere there in the middle where they're kind of ambivotes. You know, they they're not an extreme introvert or extrovert. And I think we all know who are the ones who are the extremes. They're kind of obvious even through like five seconds of talking to them.

And maybe you don't know what if they're you don't know how they are reacting to what you're saying, but maybe they'll come back later with an incredibly thoughtful compassionate response to what you've told them.

And I find the link between dopamine and introvert and the introversion, extroversion dimension really interesting. Because through dopaminergic terms, it does actually take introverts more work to get energized over what we call primal rewards. Things like social status, power, social attention, positive social attention, networking events, risky sex, those sorts of things we'd call them primal rewards. Introverts, with the way their dopaminergic system functions, they tend to have to work a little bit harder to get energized for those things. Whereas extroverts tend to have this more naturally dopaminergic functioning to those more primal rewards centers of their brain. So it naturally energizes them more and can show as enthusiasm for those things. However, there are a lot of misconceptions about introverts, and there are also a",

And I think it's really important to acknowledge, I wrote this article in Scientific American, summarizing some research, some very interesting research, showing that both introverts and extroverts get exhausted from too much socializing. So even extroverts are human too, believe it or not. Even the most extroverted of the extrovert, while they're threshold for getting tired from socializing, maybe higher than the introvert, they still too at a certain point can get exhausted from too much socializing. So we're just talking about thresholds here, and dopamine plays an important role in that sense of whether or not you're feeling energized and wanting to put in the work towards something. That's really a big role of dopamine, and it's in the role plays in the human motivational system.

So the kind of items for politeness are respect authority, hate to seem pushy, avoid imposing my will and others, and for compassion is things like fuel others emotions, inquire about others while being, take an interest in other people's lives. Now this is where it's interesting to note that each of the aspects of each of the big five can actually pull apart in various ways. So you can score really high in politeness, but not compassion, or really high in compassion and not politeness. And some of these aspects can have unique correlations on things in the world. We will revisit this later when we show that maybe politeness is not as beneficial as compassion. Interesting to me from a",

So that's interesting to note, compassion seems to be associated with a separate neuroscientific foundation. Within the agreeable disagreeableness domain, I'm really interested in the dark triad and it's counterpart, which my researchers and I came up with. So the dark triad is a very well studied set of antagonistic or disagreeable personality dimensions. We have narcissism, psychopathy, and macchi valinism. So narcissism is a very entitled self-importance. Psychopathy has to do with with meanness, lying, deceit, and macchi valinism has to do with a very strategic long-term manipulation of what you want to get out of others, being fine",

So we created a light triad scale, which is not the exact opposite of the dark triad. You can actually score high in the dark triad, also score somewhat on the light triad as well, or all sorts of different combinations, high on the light triad, and have a little dark triad. But we do see it as a nice counterpart to the dark triad. So the three main aspects of the light triad are continism, faith in humanity, and humanism.

It shows the different items associated with each of the three members of the light triad. So let me just give you some examples from each of these. So an example of humanism would be like, I tend to admire others. I tend to applaud the successes of other people. For continism, we have prefer honesty over charm. I like to be authentic, even if it may damage my reputation. And for faith in humanity, I tend to see the best in people, and I'm quick to forgive people who",

So under the openness to experience part, you can be really open to engaging in the full breadth and depth of your emotions. And you can also really be interested in creativity, aesthetics, and the imagination. And then on the intellect side, we can have just pure raw IQ or what I called explicit cognitive ability because I was trying to contrast it from more intuitive intelligence or implicit learning as well as intellectual engagement. So I want to be very clear. It's important to distinguish the extent to which you enjoy intellectual pursuits and like engaging intellectual pursuits and your raw IQ or explicit cognitive ability. Your cognitive ability could be very high, but you might not be a very intellectual curious",

Creativity often involves having to shift goals, having to be flexible. Remember, talk about the stability personality trait at the beginning.
